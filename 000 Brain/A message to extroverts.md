# a message to extroverts 

One of the most common throughlines that continues to my satisfaction is high-quality collaboration. 

1. Conversation 
2. Work
3. Sports

A sense of connection with others that unavoidably generates more than I can individually? 

How do we facilitate collaboration in all elements of our lives?? 

### this isn’t McDonald’s 
You can’t always have it your way. How to collaborate without anybody else there?
