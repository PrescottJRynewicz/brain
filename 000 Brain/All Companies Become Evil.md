# All Companies Become Evil

This is a quote from Willie that I reference a lot. 

I think [[📐 Goodhart's Law]] has some valuable information about capitalism. 

1. All for-profit companies exist to make money. No matter how emotionally charged and moral their "mission" is - if they are a for-profit company, they exist to make money. 
2. As a company moves farther away from creation, it becomes more and more challenging for employees to stand by the company's mission and values. Even if the company experienced rapid growth solving the noble problem they set out to, the bell will eventually toll: the macro-economy will change, a worthy competitor will come along, or an investor will get cold feet from relevant insider info.
3. When a company now has a history of financial performance, investors, the public market, or your wallet will begin to judge you harshly. The most straightforward and competitive measure quickly grows in strength. When your revenue has dropped 10%, no one will be touting the increased ethics of this year's products: Morality as a measure is a game for financially successful companies.  Before you know it, an organization whose mission is "**to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful**", is selling everyone's semi-private data to anyone willing to pay for it.


I also believe this is in conflict to [[Seth Godin]]'s theory about gifting in [[🔩 Linchpin]]. In a world with a gifting culture, the likelihood of all companies becoming evil is decreased.
