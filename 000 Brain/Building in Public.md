# Building in Public - Superbud

Annie and I are currently driving from Fullerton to New York. For the drive, Micah and Marnina recommended a podcast entitled "Dead Eyes". It is a serial podcast that explores how a middle-aged actor life was disrupted because Tom Hanks fired him from the cast of the 2001 HBO mini-series "Band of Brothers". 

Despite it's strange description, it is a wonderfully crafted exploration of the human psyche, and full of wonderful stories from recognizable and unrecognizable people. 

There are many examples of a "small world" in the show - particularly within show business, but also between any social connections. 

During this drive, I also got some sad news that Limitless did not want to move forward with any more conversations for employment at the company. This came after two very unofficial calls with the co-founder and head of engineering, with no official positions posted. This let down caused me to reflect on my intent for the superbud position. Even though the day before I was turned down from Limitless, I told Annie "there is a 70/30 chance I choose Superbud anyway, but this would be a nice option to explore."

As always, when that option was taken away, I only wanted it more. 

The obvious phases of grief also set in briefly. Sadness, self-doubt, disbelief, and so on. 

But, after one day of driving from Boulder Colorado to Des Moines Iowa, on the 11th hour of driving after a heart Chipotle dinner, there was a particularly inspiring set of episodes on "Dead Eyes". Guests in the range of Judd Apatow to an unknown writer of The Tonight Show spoke about failure in life, and how those failures eventually led them to work with people they were more genuinely connected with. 


The combination of failure and community hit me hard, and got me as excited about the Superbud position as I was before negative decision from Limitless. It also clicked for me that one of my superpowers is building and participating in community, specifically by leading teams. This has always been my most natural stance to take, and has also led to the most rewarding and happy moments of my life. And by happy, I don't mean "stressed out of my skull but proud of what we're doing." I genuinely mean "excited when I go to bed at night to see my co-workers tomorrow to work on a problem I am excited about."

The superbud position may be one of the best opportunites I will have to do this. In previous opportunities, I have either had no resources to help build a team, or I was not the final decision maker for how to build the team and who was on it. Although Superbud might be missing a few other items I would like to explore in my career, it may have the most important one - that I get to flex my superpower of community, and create new partners that extend past the love of craft. 


This inspired me to write a piece explaining why I am taking work at Superbud, and what my intentions for the position are. 

### Topics to Consider
The paradox of "work won't love you back" and "mission-driven teams."
The power of shared problem-solving and respected collaboration.
Everyone on a team is at least 20% of a leader - and the example of the Pareto principle. 
Communication is your most powerful tool. 
Balance - work wonâ€™t love you back.
