# Creating art for yourself is very different than creating it for others.

Art is art because it inspires something in someone. You can create that only inspires you, and that is all that is needed to make the art worth it. Passion projects, personal gardens, and private journals are all forms that only have one intended audience member, yourself. 

Other forms of art intend to infect others. This is not better or worse than creating art for yourself, but it does change the strategy of creation. It is easy to derive passion and inspiration when creating art for others. Being able to inspire joy, creativity, happiness, or meaning in someone else is one of the deepest and most profound emotions. Have you ever cried while watching someone else experience an emotional waterfall? 

Ideally, you are able to find an intersection of your art where it satisfies personal interests, leverages the tools and craft at your disposal, and can affect others. But, when creating for others, you need to understand that there are tradeoffs. Here are some rules when creating for others. 

1. It doesn't matter if you don't ship your work. Nobody can be affected by something they never see. 
2. Perfection is to be avoided. One person's perfection is another person's WTF. Art and creation are imperfect by nature. Become comfortable ripping out and letting go of the most personally putrid portions of your art, and sip everything else you can stomach.
