# Dial-up Internet

#### What is Dial-up internet?
?
It was built by America Online (AOL) and released in 1991. It was called dial-up because it used the existing telephone infrastructure.
Dial-up connections use modems to decode audio signals into data to send to a router or computer, and to encode signals from the latter two devices to send to another modem at the ISP (service provider).
