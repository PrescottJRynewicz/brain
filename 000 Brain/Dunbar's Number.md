# Dunbar's Number

#### What is Dunbar's Number?
?
The theoretical limit is the number of relationships one person can have. 
The quality and strength of relationships are unevenly distributed. Someone could only have ten best and no acquaintances, or they could have one best friend and 30 confidants. The diagram below is simple to paint and explain, but each individual's relationships are much less quantum than this.
