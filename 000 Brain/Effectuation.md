#### What is Effectuation and How is Different than Causation?
?
Effectuation is a process to take advantage of the resources you have now to create new opportunities - a bottoms up approach. Causation says, "If I do this, I will get this outcome", and it a top-down approach.
Effectuation is a much better strategy when working with unstable problems, and vice versa.
