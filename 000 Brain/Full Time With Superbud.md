# Full Time With Superbud

### Why would I bet on this? 
1. Extreme flexibility. 
	2. Working with project contracts is extremely flexible. I reserve the majority of my time for my own ventures and interests.
2. Ownership
	1. I started early and own one of their products now, maybe multiple soon. This ownership is fulfilling and good leverage for my personal and financial growth at the company.
3. Bringing technical and product excellence to a field that isn't technically focused
	1. Modern tech could greatly serve mid-market dispensaries and are willing to pay for it. 
	2. I would need to do my own research to validate this
4. Ryan and Arman's track record
	1. I would also need to look into what their success has actually been.
