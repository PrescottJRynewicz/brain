# Haze is like an airy marshmallow

Flying into NY on October 4th, 2023, the air was thick, humid, orange, and beautiful. We swept around the southern edge of the city, turning into Jersey to land. The Boeing banked right, giving my window seet a perfectly framed view of Manhattan. It looked as if the city was sitting frozen inside of the airiest orange peep.
