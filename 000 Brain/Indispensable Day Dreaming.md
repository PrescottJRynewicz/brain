#### Potential Titles
Why You Should Say No More Often - The Art of Vacuum Manufacturing - Crying on My Turkey Club - How to Have a Million Dollar Idea - How To Become Indispensable - Scale Your Creative Self - I Dare You To Create Art - How To Avoid Average - Day Dream to


## Thesis
We were not taught to be creative, and our culture doesn't foster our creativity. 

It it worth the effort to explore your creative self. It will benefit every job you could have, your personal relationships, and any career you choose to have. 

### Ideas / Stories to Tell
1. We are all artists
2. The people we look up to most are creative people - rarely do we look up to people who follow an existing playbook.
3. The base-level expectations of professional information workers are absurd - here is how you can excel in any job. 
4. The dangers of flow state 

## Research 
See if there is a fun anecdote from the vacuum world to go with the title.  


## Examples of non-obvious information - A story from my lunch

When I was laid off a few months ago, I observed something very interesting within hours of my unemployment. 

Food tasted amazing. Not just one meal, but everything I hate for weeks and months after my unemployment. 

At first, I thought this was a release of stress. But this wasn't true. I wasn't very stressed at work, and had the freedom to diversify my interests and types of healthy stress I was exposed to. 

What actually happened, was that it was the first time I had the space to aware how delicious food is. Even though I had the free space to use (a luxury many people don't have in high pressure work), I chose to fill it with anything and everything (sometimes, all at once, which is a panic attack). 

This is a flaw of mine. I have anxiety, and it is difficult to turn off the flood of thoughts that are never constant, only ever gaining or losing momentum. 

Work filled a high percentage of my attention, but also caused me to hyper-focus on my leisure activities even more, allowing no free space to come about. 

This is why I only would perform a few creative acts a year. Singing a song, writing a post, etc... Usually these happened after some sort of traumatic event, or after I let space be empty. 

Here is a very direct and specific example of this practice of making space. 

I had the idea for this passage while sitting at 34.061946, -118.444205. I was listening to Rick Ruben's new book. Serendipitously, he discussed the idea of creating a vacuum that I had written about the week before. I was inspired by the first few chapters of his book, and the practices he discusses for listening to what's in and around you. 

After finishing my workout, I picked up a Sandwich, and sat down. I usually watch 15 minutes of my favorite daily show while eating as a form of decompression and entertainment. Inspired by Rick, I chose to sit, and do nothing instead of watch. 

While eating, I noticed more than I had in a long time. That my Sandwich artist put the cheese on the bottom of the sandwich. That Jersey Mike's slices their meat really, really thin. That trader joe's is selling a fun new color scheme of potted plants. 

Before attempting this practice of awareness, I had a moment of anxiety. I literally got scared of doing nothing, because I am so accustomed to absorbing so much information at one time, and change is scary. 

In this practice of awareness, I took a deeply delicious bite of my sandwich (thank you, tomato and mayonnaise). While marveling at my bite's deliciousness, I felt a pinhole poke into my vacuum. This pinhole soon burst into a waterfall. The empty space I created was flooded with an awareness of deep ecstasy. I don't know why, it just did. Maybe it was the difficult workout I completed. Maybe the sun was entering my eyeballs in just the right way. My god himself made my sandwich. I'll never know.

I cried on my club and had the idea about this passage at the same time, all because I chose to do nothing. It was the most rewarding experience of my week, and I hope it inspires something in you, and you create something else to put into the universe. 


## **Rules**

**Ship at all costs.**
The inertia of art is extremely high. Releasing your art to be judged by the world is horrifying. There is a reason why public speaking is our most common fear. We have evolved as social creatures - exposing our soft underbelly to be judged by our peers is antithetical to our strongest instincts. 

**Don't Be Held Down**
If you work for an organization that doesn't value this - don't work there. It is better to spend the time finding a job that does value this instead of working towards prestige or other vanity metrics. 


## Strategies

**Say No More Often**

This is a very common topic in work improvement culture. There are [plenty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RexdAmTVGh4&ab_channel=TimFerriss) of good articles about why you say no more often. 

This advice usually applies to managers, leaders, and people whose time is stressed. I would argue that this applies to all people. 

All of our best ideas come when we are not working and when we have created space for diffuse thinking. This is especially true for uniquely creative ideas that cannot be replicated by others. (Add quote from Full Engagement). 

If you want to be good at following the rules and having others created systems for your life, then this is not important. But if you want to accept the challenge to create your own rules to live by, and have the potential for unbounded growth that somebody else can define or restrain you to, you have to learn when and how to say no. This applies for everyone: CEOs and entry level sales people. 

Don't expect to master the craft of vacuum manufacturing, and when you do, don't expect to be constantly bombarded with epiphanies. You may only have one moment like this a day, week, or month, but that moment is the moment when you create the majority of your value. 

> *The law of Linchpin Leverage: The more value you create in your job, the fewer minutes of labor you actually spend creating that value*. 


### Sprinting and Crawling
> *Sprinting* has been adopted as a tool for building products and technologies using the tenants of effectuation. Ship quickly, iterate, learn, etc... 
> *Sprint* is an apt description for the majority of the cycle. But I want to make a few distinctions. Sprinting occurs when you are executing, which is the majority of the time. Executing means using a skilled craft to translate an idea into a shareable asset. 
> But, the much more important and valuable part of effectuation is awareness, reflection, and creativity. This should be done slowly, and space must be preserved for this critical thinking. 



Pareto principle, when you start edging towards perfection, you will hit diminishing returns. But, because you have momentum, it is easy to stay on this path and continue perfectly. Much harder to break the cycle, and go back to an empty canvas. But the empty canvas is the only place where you can make another breakthrough.  


*Amazingly, there's a second kind of linchpin. This person says "no" all the time. She says no because she has goals, because she's a practical visionary because she understands priorities. She says no because she has the strengti to disappoint you now in order to delight you later. When used with good intent, this negative linchpin is also priceless. She is so focused on her art that she knows that a no now is a worthy investment for the magic that will be delivered later.*  - Seth Godin - Linchpin


```
This simple formula bothers me for two reasons:

1. ﻿﻿﻿Are you really willing to sell yourself out so cheap? Do you mortgage an entire (irreplaceable) day of your life for a few bucks? The moment you are willing to sell your time for money is the moment you cease to be the artist you're capable of being.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Is that it? Is the transaction over? If we're even at the end of the day as the formula says, then you owe me nothing and I owe you nothing in return. If we're even, then there is no bond, no ongoing connection between us. It's like Hector in Queens. You have become a day laborer and I have become a day boss.*


- Linchpin
```



Diffuse thinking can have a schedule - but that schedule must exclude interrupting activities. Walking, reading, working out etc... are all good examples. My most valuable ideas usually come after intense interval or weight training. For example, I wrote the speech for my best friends wedding at the top of a mountain in the middle of a cycling workout. I had no intention to write this, but at the peak of my adrenaline high, I had to choice to stop my ride, and put down my thoughts. It was one of the most emotional and creative performances I have ever had, and it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't taken a break to ride my bike, rest my brain, and stress my body.

Don’t analyze during this time, just be aware. See Ruben’s *The Creative Act* - chapter on awareness.

## Notion Copy 
By definition, **you are average at most things**. In stark contrast, **no one wants to be average**. If most of us are average at most things, how do we avoid the event horizon on the black hole of mediocrity and stand out in a permanently average world?

---

Everyone I admire, independent of their life and career, has one thing in common. They share their creative insights, and they have a lot of them.

Foremost examples of inspiring creative people are easy to find. Beyonce was born with one of the greatest voices of all time. Elon Musk has been a technical genius since before he started kindergarten. Phil Collins can’t help but write music so inspiring that we make memes about them 30 years later. We idolize them, simplify their stories into parables we preach, and categorize them as super-human.

So, how am I, the Average Joe, supposed to be as creative and inspiring as the man who wrote Two Worlds, Two Worlds Reprise, and Two Worlds Radio Version?

You probably won’t be - at least not in any way you or I can imagine right now. But that’s the beautiful thing about creation. You are the one who gets to decide what to create, and when you do, you remove yourself from being the subject of average.

In an interview, Bob Dylan once said, “My records were never perfect… I am no mainstream artist”. The interviewer reminded Dylan, “But you’ve sold over one hundred million records?”

“Yeah, I know. It’s a mystery to me, too.”

Learning how to flex your creative muscles and share your ideas with others is one of the most rewarding and universally valuable skills that is available to all of us. And it’s more important now than ever before.

# 🫚 The Root of Creation: What is Art

Rick Rubin defines art as “**To bring something into existence that wasn’t there before.”**

Seth Godin’s definition is “_****A personal gift that changes the recipient.”****_

I define art as ************a vulnerable expression made available for others to receive.************ My definition has two parts:

1. Art is vulnerable - meaning it comes from your experience and shares something about yourself.
2. It is available for others to receive. It must be shared and available to affect someone else.

### ******************************Art Can Be Made Anywhere******************************

You can be an artist as a Starbucks barista, a construction worker, a musician, or a software engineer. We all create art every day without knowing it. A new way of communicating a technical concept to a co-worker is art. A child-like fart joke that makes your partner laugh is art. A _sick 🤙_ new strategy to win a game of fortnight is art.

We all have the natural gift to create, and **this skill is more valuable now than ever before**.

But, the world has not been set up for us to leverage our creativity.

### We Were Not Taught To Create

Technology is accelerating. Quickly.

There have been five technical revolutions in the modern era.

Agricultural: 1600-1740.

Industrial: 1780-1840

Technical: 1870-1920

Scientific: 1940-1970

Information: 1975-2021

![Source](https://www.datocms-assets.com/105541/1695947756-tech-growth.png)

[Source](https://jmtconsulting.com/blog/technology-matters-to-nonprofits-the-impact-of-falling-behind-the-technology-curve/)

Each revolution has come faster than the last and brings even more change.

The Technical Revolution (or the Second Industrial Revolution) occurred between 1870 and 1920. The modern US school system was developed at the same time (all states had tax-subsidized subsidized elementary schools by 1870 ). During the Technical Revolution, we got really good at building machines and mass-producing goods. Inventing machines is very difficult. Working with them is easy once you get past the initial learning curve.

Our earliest machines all required humans in the loop. Thus, the need for cheap factory labor was born, and the greedy claws of capitalism stepped in to do its job.

---

> _We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity, in every society, to forgo the privileges of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks._

Woodrow Wilson

The 28th president of the United States made it very clear that the modern education system was not designed to leverage our creativity. Schools were created to teach us how to be a cog in a machine. Be here on time, don’t speak out of turn, learn what I say, and you’ll get a good grade. Turn this piece of metal as fast as possible, and we’ll give you a steady paycheck, provide you with modern comforts, guarantee you’re retirement, and cap your downside.

Although Wilson’s quote feels like one of the more evil statements ever written, this plan worked well to help progress the world forward. Sure, working in a factory may not sound great, but relative to life before the technical revolution, the ability to have a steady job, resources to support your family, and some free time to engage in leisure was incredibly novel to the average American.

A hundred years later, the rules have changed, and our systems don’t have time to catch up. The means of production are distributed, readily available, and becoming universally automated. We don’t need rule followers; we need creators.

### 🎨 Arts and Crafts

Art and craft are not the same thing.

A craft is a set of technical skills to turn ideas into reality. Learning piano allows you to share ideas through music. Learning how to design allows you to share ideas through virtual or physical representations.

> A craft is required to share art, but craft alone does not make art.

Having enough craftsmanship to replicate the Mona Lisa is not art. Even the skill Da Vinci used to paint the Mona Lisa is not art. The art was Da Vinci’s idea to employ jesters while painting to avoid the typical melancholy expression of subjects during the High Renaissance.

**Craft is only useful to the extent that it helps translate an idea outside yourself.**

---

When I grew up, I played many instruments and was above average at most of them. I had the chance to participate in many high-achieving music groups, and I intended to make performance my career for most of middle and high school. I was labeled as “creative” because I was constantly “creating” music.

I played with thousands of people from 6th to 12th grade, but out of all of them, I looked up to one person the most. This person wasn’t the best at their instrument, didn’t do well in classical settings, and was particularly horrible at marching music. This person was remarkable because they were the only person I knew who actually did the work to create.

While the rest of us were learning skills to copy others, they were inventing. They were writing weird Jazz songs, making up new notes on the saxophone, and swapping parts from one instrument to another. They didn’t fit in because they were creating their own world. What they were doing could not be compared to what the rest of us were doing.

The rest of us were learning a craft. I was very good at mimicking the creation of others and learning how to do it quickly. My ability to learn new craft was impressive, but also very short-sided. The day I decided not to be a professional musician was the day I had to perform my first improvised solo. The first time I was challenged to look into myself and create instead of mimic was so difficult and scary, that I immediately decided to give up on the thing I loved most.

# 💪 Art is Labor

We tend to separate creative efforts from traditional labor, just as we dissociate physical and mental ailments. It is easy to see construction as a job because you have to exert obvious physical energy to complete it. Painting in your free time is not work; it’s a relaxing leisure activity.

Contrary to popular belief, creating art is the hardest job of all.

Learning a craft may or may not be difficult for you based on your natural talents. Learning how to ship your art is difficult for everyone.

Craft can and should be learned efficiently. Learn from other’s experiences, employ well-known strategies, mimic others, and compare your skills.

Art, on the other hand, cannot be fast or efficient. It is impossible to optimize the unknown, and you must move slowly to capture the new world you are seeing.

## 🎭 Why You Should Do The Work

### Art Is ******************Deeply Satisfying******************

Once you can find the intersection of your creativity and craft, shipping your creative work is a deeply satisfying experience.

I once played a game of Codenames, a game where you give clues to your teammates so they can guess one of many cards in a set. It was the final turn of the game, and I had the seemingly impossible task of connecting three items with a one-word hint: A hospital, Saturn, and a record player. In a moment of unique creativity, I realized that my partner, who was a nurse, would recognize that the word “rotation” applies to shifts at a hospital and also describes how a planet and record player move. I gave the hint, my partner connected the dots, and to the shock of our opponents, we won the game.

This is the silliest and most insignificant example of my creative efforts, but it was deeply satisfying and only available to me because of my unique experience with the world.

### Learning How to Create ********************Will Help You Learn About Yourself********************

### Art Is **************The Most Valuable Skill**************

Although we separated arts from crafts above, there are things that the two share. Art and creativity is a skill that can be practiced and improved.

### **********You Are The Best At Something**********

- You are the best at something.
- Paradoxically, it will teach you a skill set relevant to any career you choose.
- It will teach you how to connect with your deepest intentions and spirituality, which will be an incredible guide for your life and filter out the intense and chaotic noise of the world.
- You are alive during the best time to have an impact on other people’s lives. By sharing your creativity, you increase the odds that one of your ideas will benefit you and the world around you. Even if none of them do (this is likely), you will almost certainly increase your opportunity to work on deeply meaningful and history-altering projects by developing the skill and bravery to think creatively and ship your art.

# Strategies For Creation

- Art is not efficient. Art is patient, slow, brave, and laborious.
- Say no more often.
- Being uncomfortable is good. Be aware of the feeling, observe it, and let it sit there. You will come out better on the other side having not solved the problem of feeling uncomfortable.
- Create a vacuum. Be aware and listen to what comes into the vacuum. Just like the physical universe, we cannot create a perfect vacuum, and our vacuums are usually small and only last for a very short time.
- Listen with your whole body, and practice awareness.
- Create useful distractions.

# Outro: I Cried On My Turkey-Club

I was laid off in July of 2023. I observed something interesting within hours of unemployment - food tasted amazing. Not just one meal but everything I ate for weeks after my unemployment.

At first, I thought this was a release of stress or some other form of decompression - neither of these was true. I wasn't very stressed at work and had the freedom to diversify my interests and recover appropriately. The reason I was quickly transported to Flavor Town post-employment was quite different.

---

I have a very strong internal monologue and some general anxiety. I am constantly bombarded with thoughts, internal alarms, ideas, and excitement. This is a superpower and curse. Most of my peers see me as an overachiever - multiple people have told my partner, “It must be annoying to date Prescott; he is good at everything.” My ego loves this, and the little voice in my head points out all the things I know I am not good at.

The curse is that I lack patience, judge others harshly, and work very hard to quiet my internal monologue and nurse the anxiety constantly pushing me to do more right now.

For my entire life, I have never felt like I have enough time. During school, I wished I had more time to play another sport, join another music group, or spend more time on side projects. In my professional career, I have always oscillated between fully engaged and completely disconnected, obsessed with a new hobby.

What actually happened when I was laid off was that it was that it was the first time I was free of full-time responsibilities since kindergarten. Luckily, the poor performance of my company was a strong enough force to create an immediate 60% vacuum of awareness, and the first thing to fill that space was, “damn, eggs taste good.”

---

This is why I only would perform a few creative acts a year. Singing a song, writing a post, etc... Usually these happened after some sort of traumatic event, or after I let space be empty.

Here is a very direct and specific example of this practice of making space.

I had the idea for this passage while sitting at 34.061946, -118.444205. I was listening to Rick Ruben's new book. Serendipitously, he discussed the idea of creating a vacuum that I had written about the week before. I was inspired by the first few chapters of his book, and the practices he discusses for listening to what's in and around you.

After finishing my workout, I picked up a Sandwich, and sat down. I usually watch 15 minutes of my favorite daily show while eating as a form of decompression and entertainment. Inspired by Rick, I chose to sit, and do nothing instead of watch.

While eating, I noticed more than I had in a long time. That my Sandwich artist put the cheese on the bottom of the sandwich. That Jersey Mike's slices their meat really, really thin. That trader joe's is selling a fun new color scheme of potted plants.

Before attempting this practice of awareness, I had a moment of anxiety. I literally got scared of doing nothing, because I am so accustomed to absorbing so much information at one time, and change is scary.

In this practice of awareness, I took a deeply delicious bite of my sandwich (thank you, tomato and mayonnaise). While marveling at my bite's deliciousness, I felt a pinhole poke into my vacuum. This pinhole soon burst into a waterfall. The empty space I created was flooded with an awareness of deep ecstasy. I don't know why, it just did. Maybe it was the difficult workout I completed. Maybe the sun was entering my eyeballs in just the right way. My god himself made my sandwich. I'll never know.

I cried on my club and had the idea about this passage at the same time, all because I chose to do nothing. It was the most rewarding experience of my week, and I hope it inspires something in you, and you create something else to put into the universe.

# The Power of Creativity: Unlocking Your Inner Artist

Creativity is a fundamental aspect of the human experience. It allows us to express ourselves, think outside the box, and generate new ideas and solutions. Yet, many of us struggle to tap into our creative potential. In this blog post, we will explore the importance of creativity and provide strategies to unleash your inner artist.

## Embracing Your Uniqueness

By definition, each one of us is unique. We possess a set of experiences, perspectives, and talents that no one else has. Embracing this uniqueness is the first step towards unlocking your creativity. Recognize that you have something valuable to contribute to the world, and your ideas deserve to be heard.

## Creating Space for Inspiration

In our fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life. However, true creativity requires space for inspiration to flourish. Take time to disconnect from technology, quiet your mind, and allow your thoughts to wander. Engage in activities that bring you joy and ignite your curiosity. Whether it's taking a walk in nature, practicing mindfulness, or pursuing a hobby, creating space for inspiration is essential.

## Embracing the Fear of Imperfection

One of the biggest obstacles to creativity is the fear of imperfection. We often hesitate to share our ideas or creations because we worry they won't be good enough. However, it's important to remember that creativity is a process, and not every idea will be a masterpiece. Embrace the imperfections and view them as opportunities for growth and learning. Allow yourself to take risks and explore new possibilities without the fear of judgment.

## Cultivating a Creative Mindset

Creativity is not limited to artistic endeavors. It can be applied to any area of life, whether it's problem-solving, innovation, or personal growth. Cultivating a creative mindset involves being open to new ideas, seeking out diverse perspectives, and challenging traditional thinking. Practice curiosity, ask questions, and embrace a sense of wonder. By approaching life with a creative mindset, you'll find new solutions and opportunities where others see obstacles.

## Nurturing Your Creative Process

Just like any skill, creativity needs to be nurtured and practiced regularly. Set aside dedicated time for creative activities and make them a priority. Whether it's writing, painting, playing an instrument, or cooking, engage in activities that allow you to express yourself and tap into your creative flow. Surround yourself with supportive and like-minded individuals who can inspire and encourage your creative journey.

## Sharing Your Creativity with the World

Creativity is not meant to be kept hidden. It is a gift meant to be shared with others. Don't be afraid to share your ideas, creations, and perspectives with the world. Your unique voice has the power to inspire, challenge, and make a difference. Embrace vulnerability and use your creativity to connect with others, spark conversations, and leave a lasting impact.

In conclusion, creativity is a powerful force that resides within each one of us. By embracing our uniqueness, creating space for inspiration, overcoming the fear of imperfection, cultivating a creative mindset, nurturing the creative process, and sharing our creativity with the world, we can unlock our inner artist and make a meaningful contribution to the world.

So, go ahead, embrace your creativity, and let your imagination soar. The world is waiting for your unique creative expression!
