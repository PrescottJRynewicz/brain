# Know Your Job's Worth


If you can't calculate how you've affected the bottom line of the team you're on, then you aren't being a Linchpin. 

Some roles have very clear expectations and criteria; sales, for example. You are a good salesperson if you hit your quota, and you know exactly how much money you brought into the company from your hard work, and crafted communication skills.

Most other positions are difficult though. Marketing, higher management, technical positions, research, etc...


I challenge you to work with yourself, and your boss to figure out why you are worth being paid. If you can do this, it will give you hyper clear focus for how to continue to add value, and open up creative avenues to improve the value you are adding. 


A classic example is the disconnect between engineers and the business. Engineers love technology. They love why things work, and they love to perfect engineered systems to be more efficient, more beautiful, more sustainable. Some engineers could do this forever. But, in almost every case, creating a beautifully engineered system is not why the engineer is there. The engineer is there because they have knowledge that another person doesn't in order to build something for a paying customer. Customers almost certainly don't care or know why a technology works, they only know if they had a good experience using it. 

When we can learn to focus on why we are valuable to a company, we actually give ourselves a chance to deliver that value. 


In Linchpin, Seth writes *This is an astonishing piece of news. A very good senior programmer gets paid about the same as a great programmer, who makes 10x more money for the company.*
