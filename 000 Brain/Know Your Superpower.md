# Know Your Superpower

*[[To Know Thyself is the beginning of wisdom]]*

You need to understand yourself before anything else of true creative value can be done for others. A simple exercise to get to the root of this is to answer the question, "What is your superpower?"

#### What is your Superpower? 
?
1. Learning mental and physical crafts (software, piano, weight lifting, sports, etc...)
2. Empathy, emotional awareness, and leadership. Communicating, connecting, listening. Examining what motivates someone, and connecting their core motivations to projects. 
3. Enough anxiety to sense problems that others can not see. Creative and confident enough to propose solutions to those problems.
4. Communication. Written and verbal.

## What is your kryptonite?
?
1. Selfishness. It takes a conscious effort for me to think of others first. 
2. Attachment. I am naturally very passionate thus, it is difficult for me to detach an outcome from my passion for the project.
3. Ego. Moderately high natural ego. Think highly of myself, and consistently remind myself to be open to new opportunities to learn.
