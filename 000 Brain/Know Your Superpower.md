# Know Your Superpower

*[[To Know Thyself is the beginning of wisdom]]*

You need to understand yourself before anything else of true creative value can be done for others. A simple exercise to get to the root of this is to answer the question, "What is your superpower?"

#### What is your Superpower? 
?
1. Learning mental and physical crafts (software, piano, weight lifting, sports, etc...)
2. Empathy, emotional awareness, and leadership. Connecting, listening, examining what motivates someone, and finding avenues for them to do their best work.
3. Enough anxiety to be sensitive to problems that others can not see. Confident enough to create and propose unique solutions to those problems.
4. Communication. Written and especially verbal. 


## What is your kryptonite?
?
1. Selfishness. It takes a conscious effort for me to think of others first. 
2. Attachment. I am naturally very passionate thus, it is difficult for me to detach an outcome from my passion for the project.
3. Ego. Moderately high natural ego. Think highly of myself, and consistently remind myself to be open to new opportunities to learn.
