# Know Your Job Worth

If you can't calculate how you've affected the bottom line of the team you're on, then you aren't being a Linchpin. 

Some roles have very clear expectations and criteria, sales, for example. You are a good salesperson if you hit your quota, and you know exactly how much money you brought into the company from your hard work, and crafted communication skills.

Most other positions are difficult though. Marketing, higher management, technical positions, research, etc...


I challenge you to work with yourself, and your boss to figure out why you are worth being paid. If you can do this, it will give you hyper clear focus for how to continue to add value, and open up creative avenues to improve the value you are adding. 


A classic example is the disconnect between engineers and the business. Engineers love technology. They love why things work, and they love to perfect engineered systems to be more efficient, more beautiful, more sustainable. Some engineers could do this forever. But, in almost every case, creating a beautifully engineered system is not why the engineer is there. The engineer is there because they have knowledge that another person doesn't in order to build something for a paying customer. Customers almost certainly don't care or know why a technology works, they only know if they had a good experience using it. 

When we can learn to focus on why we are valuable to a company, we actually give ourselves a chance to deliver that value. 


Strategically, if your value created to the company is equal to or less than you're salary, you are either bad at your job, or have the wrong job. If the value you create is 25-100% more than your salary, you are average. You create enough value for the company to keep you around. Once you start making 2x your salary, now you start to have leverage. If you know how and why you create this value, you become indispensable. If you're boss doesn't realize this, go find a better job. 


In Linchpin, Seth writes *This is an astonishing piece of news. A very good senior programmer gets paid about the same as a great programmer, who makes 10x more money for the company.*
