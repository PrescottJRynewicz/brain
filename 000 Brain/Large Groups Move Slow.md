# Large Groups Move Slow

#### Why Do Large Groups Move Slow?
?
Calculating interactions in a growing group has a quadratic relationship with the triangular number.
Increasing the number of people who have input and decision-making power in a project will create quadratic time increases in a project. 
3 people = 3 handshakes
4 people = 6 handshakes
5 people = 10 handshakes
6 people = 15 handshakes
By doubling the group size, you have 5x the amount of potential interactions. 
$$ n = Group Size - 1 $$
$$ Handshakes = (n^2 + n) / 2 $$
