# Large Groups Move Slow

#### Why Do Large Groups Move Slow?
?
Increasing the number of people who have input and decision-making power in a project will create exponential time increases in a project. 
It takes three handshakes to introduce 3 people. 
Six handshakes to introduce 4 people.
10 Handshakes to introduce 5. 
15 handshakes to introduce 6. 
By doubling the group size, you have 5x the amount of potential interactions. 
$$ Handshakes = \Sigma (n^2 + n) / 2 $$
