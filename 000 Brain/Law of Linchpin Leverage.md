# Law of Linchpin Leverage

#### What is Seth Godin's Law of Linchpin Leverage
?
The more value you create in your job, the fewer clock minutes of labor you actually spend creating that value. In other words, most of the time, you're not being brilliant. Most of the time, you do stuff that ordinary people could do.
