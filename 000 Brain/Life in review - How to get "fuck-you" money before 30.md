# ‚ÄúHow to get ‚Äúfuck-you‚Äù money by Age 30‚Äù
#### Unique Financial and Career Strategies
## Notes

Today, August 24, I was caught with an intense craving to push my writing efforts forward and create scheduled writing time. 

I had tens of ideas for how to start this process 

1. Writing about key learnings from Cameo
2. Posting on LinkedIn and socials to collect ideas about what to write about first 
3. Do a review of a specific book 


I finished reading [[üìó Optionality - Survive and Thrive]] and had a flood of creative flow afterward. 

I think it‚Äôs an appropriate first step to be lost about how I saved reading this book for a short sabbatical with the intention of exploring options. 

Talk about 
1. Feeling trapped and wanting fuck you money at Lockheed to pay off school debt. 
1. Getting bored taking time off
2. Desire to find out if I want to do the same or different things.
3. Feeling secure after saving 100K - i.e., having fuck you money. Why didn‚Äôt I invest in a property even though I felt pressure too? 
4. How this book was the perfect book to read at this time, how it positively impacted my view on this period of my life, and that I plan to double down on knowledge capital. 

Five years ago, I would have said that ‚Äúfuck-you money‚Äù is ‚Äúhaving so much money that  _blank_ meaningful-dollars to a middle-class first world be irrelevant to me‚Äù - i.e. watch me blow $1000 dollars on bottle service because I can. 

This is an amusing thought, and potentially validating to the financially insecure (me five years ago), but incomplete. 



# The Post

So, you want Fuck-You money? Well, look no further. 

I've created the world's first quick-return, web 3 first, web 2 second, formula guaranteed to earn you fuck-you money overnight. All you have to do is get 6 other people to read the formula below, and you'll earn compounding returns on every future read... üòÖ

Alright, here is the secret sauce. 

$$ F_u = Expenses * 12 $$

Oh, different from what you expected? Me too. 

### What is Fuck-You money?
If you asked the 20-year-old version of myself, in college at UCLA, beginning to learn about how the world's economy moves money around, what "fuck-you" money is, I would have said something like, "Having enough money that you could throw away an amount valuable to a middle-class American."
