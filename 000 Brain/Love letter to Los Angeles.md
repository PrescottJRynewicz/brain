I wanna be where the people are - Ariel Joke. 

Format ideas 
- Stories 
	- Mini stories of my favorite moments 
	- Rolling at the Kygo show 
	- Biking to Wilson 
	- infinite Beach days 
	- Century ride 
	- Chicken chase 
	- Hosting everyone for New Year's
	- Living through the Global Pandemic
	- The public golf courses
	- How beautiful neighborhoods are tucked behind historic streets
	- How different and diverse every neighborhood is
- Start with a bunch of complaints about Los Angeles, and then tell stories about how despite all of this, Los Angeles is still an amazing place
	- Too Big
	- Too much traffic
	- Streets are run down, and don't make sense
	-
