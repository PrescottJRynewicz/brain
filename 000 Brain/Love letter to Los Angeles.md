# A Love Letter to Los Angeles

### The City That Changed My Life

### The city that created my life’s home

Story of sitting in mid-city surrounded by the most incredible, diverse, and happy group of people 

Format ideas 
- Stories 
	- Mini stories of my favorite moments 
	- Rolling at the Kygo show 
	- Biking to Wilson 
	- infinite Beach days 
	- Century ride 
	- Chicken chase 
	- Hosting everyone for New Year's
	- Living through the Global Pandemic
	- The public golf courses
	- How beautiful neighborhoods are tucked behind historic streets
	- How different and diverse every neighborhood is
- Start with a bunch of complaints about Los Angeles, and then tell stories about how despite all of this, Los Angeles is still an amazing place. Can intro with the map reference, and how Los Angeles initially looks like a 10,000 piece jig saw puzzle. 
	- Too Big
	- Too much traffic                          
	- Streets are run down and don't make sense
	- Parking is impossible
	- People are shallow and only care about your network


### thesis
Los Angeles gave me the opportunity to create a family when I didn’t feel like I had one. Although Los Angeles may no longer be my physical home, it will always be the place where I found my forever home. The relationships and experience I gained from leaving my childhood home cannot be adequately expressed. 
### Ideas 
1. This is not a persuasive argument. It is not an internet culture war. It’s a love story. Take away the parts that make you feel something, and leave the rest. 
1. My map reference of Los Angeles. 
2. Listen to Spotify DJ to remember old feelings.
3. Weave in my own experience and how the city created opportunities to enrich my life more than I could ever imagine. 
4. Theory of relativity 
	1. Translating emotions through any medium is difficult. This is why “love” has no empirical definition. You know love once you’ve experienced it, and not before then. 
	2. I believe the theory of relativity applies here. In physics, we discuss items relative to known constants. Emotionally, we speak relative to our human experience. 
	3. Lacking better emotional communications tools, all I can say is “I love you Los Angeles”. I love you more than any city I have ever been to. 
5. Mystery & Magic
	1. Because Los Angeles is a private city full of amazing people, it creates a sense of mystery. 
	2. The hidden homes in the hills are mysterious.
6. Finishing the story with reference to the song [Brendan](https://open.spotify.com/track/4c5OXvgTs4j6YQU6j798RS?si=cc8921f13fcc45a2)
	1. A story is only a story if there is an ending. Finality creates meaning. 
	2. Write the closing act of the essay describing the scene at Alcove. 
	3. Listening to Brendan.
	4. This chapter is complete. 
	5. I look forward to the deep nostalgia that I will get to experience upon return. 
7. I wanna be where the people are - Ariel Joke.
