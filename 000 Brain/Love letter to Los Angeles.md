# A Love Letter to Los Angeles

Story of sitting in mid-city surrounded by the most incredible, diverse, and happy group of people 

I wanna be where the people are - Ariel Joke. 

Format ideas 
- Stories 
	- Mini stories of my favorite moments 
	- Rolling at the Kygo show 
	- Biking to Wilson 
	- infinite Beach days 
	- Century ride 
	- Chicken chase 
	- Hosting everyone for New Year's
	- Living through the Global Pandemic
	- The public golf courses
	- How beautiful neighborhoods are tucked behind historic streets
	- How different and diverse every neighborhood is
- Start with a bunch of complaints about Los Angeles, and then tell stories about how despite all of this, Los Angeles is still an amazing place. Can intro with the map reference, and how Los Angeles initially looks like a 10,000 piece jig saw puzzle. 
	- Too Big
	- Too much traffic
	- Streets are run down and don't make sense
	- Parking is impossible
	- People are shallow and only care about your network


### Ideas 
1. My map reference of Los Angeles.
