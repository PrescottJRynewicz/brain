# Low Thrash Decision-Making

### Audience
Anyone who works in a semi-formalized business with a hierarchies reporting structure. 

### Story
See the thesis below. Start with an image from Cameo about how poorly the decision was made to create an event pipeline and how the lack of decision-making about Back end improvements and GraphQL was going on.



#### Making Decisions is Hard

#### The Leader's Dilemma - My head is on the line for the results, so I must take control of the outcome. 

Something that is not clearly communicated to early professionals. The more senior you get, the more decision-making power you have. 

This can take two paths. Higher decision volume, or higher decision value. 

Higher decision volume is a pitfall. It does not empower the people below you, and causes you to be overwhelmed. 

Higher decision value is harder to figure out, but much more valuable. 

#### The Brute Force Solution

#### The Elegant Optimization

##### Assumptions in the elegant solution


## Tactics 

1. Write RFCs often. Review them as early as possible. Create small, focused groups for brainstorming and collaboration. 
2. Create a space (sync or async) to give everyone the opportunity to understand what decisions have been made and why.

Making decisions is hard. The larger the organization gets, the more difficult it is to make decisions. To exemplify why this is true, we can use some simple math. We can calculate the number of converging opinions within a decision-making group. 

$$ O_n = \sum_{1}^{n-1} n $$


For example, for three people to make a decision, there are `2+1 = 3` convergent opinions. 

When six people make a decision, there are `5+4+3+2+1=15` convergent opinions. We doubled the number of people making a decision but quintupled the number of opinions that need to be reconciled. 

This simple equation doesn't account for the additional mental overhead each person assumes when considering many opinions and the amount of bias introduced when collaborating with that many people. 

> Empowered organizations push decisions as far down the tree as possible. 

Krulak's law.


This is why startups can almost always outperform existing companies when competing in a new arena. 

Executives are paid the big bucks to make difficult decisions (which does not always mean they are the ones to make decisions), despite their potential lack of technical or industry knowledge. 


As an engineer (or anyone), the ability to use written communication is an essential tool for decision-making.

### Thesis
Fast-moving, empowered, and successful organizations push decision-making as far down the tree as possible. 

With hyper-clear decision-making criteria, the decision will agreeably present itself. Fight and grind over the criteria. Disagree and commit to creating a smooth decision-making process. 




**Red Flags**
Meetings are required to make a decision. 
More than a handful of people (5-8) in to be in a room to make a decision. 
Background context is shared in person
