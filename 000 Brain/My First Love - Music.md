# My First Love - Music

Tell the story of how music has affected my life. 

The image of the fourth-grade teacher playing the golden flute. 

Learning flute and not wanting to be around the girls. 

Switching to many different instruments, mostly because I wanted to be loud enough to be heard. 

Learning early and valuable leadership lessons leading music groups of hundreds of students. 

Focusing on trumpet, drum corps, and leadership in high school. 

Foregoing the luggage of an instrument in college, and singing in an a cappella group. One of the most fun and rewarding experiences I have ever had. 

Using music to express myself
