# Option Pricing Model
#### How do you Calculate An Option Pricing Model?
?
1. Find the diff between hiring someone and paying yourself (your time value)
3. Find the upfront cost and the expected use
$$
\text{Option Price} = (\text{Cost to Hire} - \text{Your own time value}) * \text{Expected Use} - \text{Upfront Cost}
$$
