# Pareto Principle

#### What is the Pareto Principle
??
It is another definition of the [[↘️ The Law of Diminishing Returns]], which says *"20% of your effort will create 80% of the effect."*

#### What is the problem with perfectionism?
?
Perfection is an issue because you run up against an asymptote of diminishing returns. There are not that many situations of true scale where optimizing past the second sigma (95%) is worth the effort spent. If you are Amazon, and that 5% is worth 100s of millions, it is probably worth. If you are an independent contractor, own a small business, or scaling an early team, perfection is not worth the time spent. Perfectionism is especially not worth it when performing creative acts, because creative acts, by definition, do not spec, and cannot be perfect.
