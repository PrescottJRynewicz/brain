# Post Key West Family Journaling

Key West and the last few family trips have been extraordinarily difficult. Every time I have interacted with my mom's side of the family in the previous five years, it has led to an intense emotional breakdown during or after the interaction. In particular, extended family trips with Mom, Joel, and Sean are the most difficult. 

While in Greece, I broke down during dinner and cried in an alley with Annie. In Key West, on our second day, I had an overflow of emotion after finishing *The Storied Life of AJ Fikry* at the beach and cried in the condo for an hour while Annie was working. 

My relationship with my family has been broken since John left. While I have personally confronted the issues and worked to create strong, healthy relationships in my own life, I have not faced the interpersonal issues between my mom and my brother. This is a log of all the confusing emotions I felt during Key West to serve as a log as I go into therapy.


#### I need to have a conversation with my mom and my brother
It is not okay that I feel so horrible on family trips. I deeply dread them; they feel like a responsibility for my mom's happiness, and I leave feeling relieved that they are over. If I want this to change, I will need to confront my own issues and eventually have conversations about it with my mom and brother. 

#### I Feel Trapped 
I feel trapped in many ways when on these trips. I feel physically trapped because I don't plan or control the trips, so I don't feel like I have the option to make changes or go at my own pace. 

I feel emotionally trapped, doing my best to make the trip meaningful to Mom even though I don't want to be on the trip. 

I feel trapped in my anxiety. The years between John leaving and my Sophomore year of college were the worst for my anxiety. My anxiety peeked the summer before college, where I didn't feel any sense of belonging to my family, limited connection to friends, and a deep fear of leaving my comfort zone. Whenever I spend time with my family, this feeling returns, always stronger than I expect. 

I feel trapped in a lie. I am doing my best to outwardly enjoy myself (as a coping mechanism for myself and as a front for my mom), while the whole time, my head is spinning with intrusive negative thoughts about my mom and my brother. 


#### Intrusive Negative Thoughts
List of all the things that enter my head when spending time with family. 


**I disagree with most of my brother's choices**
Sean's engagement with the MLM and the community he has latched onto trigger my anxiety. It frustrates me cause they contaminate all his relationships with a vail of salesmanship. It scares me because I worry about the potential fall from an unknowingly high cliff he continues to climb, and how obsessed he is with getting to the top. 


**My Brother Does Not Seem Well Adjusted**
During the trip, Sean didn't contribute to any conversation. When we were eating at the Conch Republic, he didn't say anything for the entire dinner and spent most of it on his phone, responding to water messages. It was clear that Taylor was upset at him about something, but I'm unsure if they have the skills to communicate.

**I don't like that Joel pays for everything**
In particular, I don't like that Joel pays for everything for my mom. She is quite dependent on Joel and not very self-reliant. I know she can be if she needs to, but the longer she is dependent on Joel, the more difficult it is going to be to rely on herself if they don't stay together. 

I am not sure that Joel is the best person for her either. I think it is an easy relationship; my mom appreciates everything Joel does for her, and Joel likes having Mom around, but I do not consider their relationship balanced, happy, healthy. 


**I hate that Mom brings up so many negative topics**
It seems inevitable that Mom will bring up something deeply depressing about past or current events during any conversation. This makes me worried about the negative concepts she is focusing on, and not enjoyable for everyone else to be confronted by difficult topics.  

**I am worried about Mom's physical health**
Mom is overweight and doesn't do much exercise at all. She says she gets around 8,000 steps a day. I would expect the average to be lower than that (because we all exaggerate), and even if she did, 8,000 steps a day is not enough exercise. 

If she has a fall, she could be seriously injured. Her joints and tendons haven't experienced healthy stress in a long time. Anybody of her age needs to be doing regular zone 2 exercise, and resistance training to protect against the dangers of falling. In her weight class, she needs to be doing above average amounts of all this.

On top of this, she is having shoulder problems. She can experience excruciating pain in her shoulder when walking, which continues to lower her activity. 

She drinks more than she should to cope with her anxiety and stress. I don't know about her drinking habits at home, but I think she has multiple glasses of wine every night. One glass might be okay, but anything more than that is only exacerbating her existing health issues. 

**I don't like that Mom doesn't listen very well and repeats the same exact conversations tens of times with us**
During one dinner, I asked Mom if she was able to eat spices like freshly ground pepper. She said she could, and then immediately launched into the same speech I have heard her give tens of times "It is only fresh onion and garlic, but you know, I have this enzyme now..." - I interrupted her in frustration and attempted to lightly tell her that I know about the enzyme, which we have talked about it ad nauseam. This small comment made her so upset she broke down in tears. My comment was not the most gentle thing I have ever done, but it is unbearable hearing her repeat the same exact depressing statement in essentially every conversation I have with her. 


**Nobody is a good conversationalist**
Nobody has the social or listening skills to have a good conversation. Most time spent is full of awkward silences, then someone asks a nothing question that no one responds or adds to, and eventually leads to another awkward silence. Everyone is honestly not that interesting or well-rounded and doesn't have a large pool of material to pull from to contribute to other people.
