# Priced vs. Non-Priced Round

#### What is the difference between a priced and non-priced funding round?
?
A priced round is a funding agreement in which the company's value is defined and agreed upon—e.g., the company is worth 50 million dollars. A non-priced round is the opposite, in which the company's value is not set.
**Key differences**
* **Timing of Valuation**: Priced rounds immediately set the company’s valuation, whereas non-priced rounds defer valuation to a future event.
* **Complexity**: Priced rounds involve more negotiation and legal work to set terms and determine valuation. Non-priced rounds are generally simpler and faster to execute.
* **Investor Rights**: Priced rounds usually provide investors with more defined rights and protections from the outset, whereas non-priced rounds may defer these details until conversion.
