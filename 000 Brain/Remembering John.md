# Remembering John

Thank you for being there to show me what family feels like.

Unfortunately, bad is stronger than good. A single cockroach in a bowl of cherries will ruin the whole, but a single cherry will have no affect on a bowl of cockroaches. 

A lot of time has been spent confused, angry, resentful, sad, and guilty. 

Runner’s high - after 2.5 hours of intense beach volleyball, I came home, refreshed myself with 24Oz of Mexican lager, and then fell to the floor crying, as the adrenaline of a runner’s high dumped through my system. 

These moments happen a few times a year. They are cathartic, painful, and healing. 

Usually, sadness is the primary emotion during one of these sessions. I am sad that we never had an adult relationship, and I am gutted thinking about him passing without what used to be our family around him. 

Resentment and questioning also comes up once in a while. Was our life better with him? Was the few good years worth a lifetime of trauma and loss? 

This most recent dump came with a new revelation. 

Piece about John. 

Story about how life made sense and was full of “perfect moments”. 

“Good food days” 
Home runs at baseball games. 
Playing with Saidy in the backyard.
