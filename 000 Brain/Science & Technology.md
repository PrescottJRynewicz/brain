#### What was Alan Turing's role in World War II?
?
Alan Turing played a crucial role in World War II as a leading codebreaker at Bletchley Park, the British codebreaking centre. He was instrumental in developing techniques and machines, including the Bombe, to decrypt the German Enigma-encrypted messages, significantly contributing to the Allied victory.

#### What is Alan Turing most famous for in computer science?
?
Alan Turing is most famous for his development of the Turing machine concept, a fundamental model of computation that can simulate any algorithm's logic. He's also known for the Turing Test, a criterion for determining whether a machine is capable of human-like intelligence.

#### What was the Turing Test, and what did it propose?
?
The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. According to Turing, if a human judge cannot reliably tell the machine from a human based on their replies to questions, the machine can be considered intelligent.

#### How did Alan Turing contribute to the development of the modern computer?
?
Alan Turing contributed to the development of the modern computer through his theoretical work, including the concept of the Turing machine, which laid the groundwork for the digital computer. He provided a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine.

#### What was the Bombe, and what role did it play in WWII?
?
The Bombe was an electromechanical machine developed by Alan Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park to help decipher the German Enigma-encrypted messages during WWII. It significantly accelerated the process of breaking Enigma codes, contributing to the Allied war effort.

#### What were the circumstances surrounding Alan Turing's death?
?
Alan Turing died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning, which was ruled a suicide. His death occurred after his conviction for homosexual acts (then illegal in the UK) and undergoing chemical castration as an alternative to prison.

#### What was Alan Turing's early contribution to mathematics?
?
Alan Turing's early contribution to mathematics includes his work on the Entscheidungsproblem, or decision problem, with the Turing machine concept, proving that a general algorithm to solve all mathematical problems does not exist.

#### How did Alan Turing's work influence the outcome of World War II?
?
Alan Turing's work in breaking the Enigma code significantly influenced the outcome of World War II by allowing the Allies to intercept and understand German military communications, thus facilitating strategic military planning and operations that hastened the end of the war.

#### What recognition did Alan Turing receive after his death?
?
After his death, Alan Turing received numerous posthumous recognitions for his contributions to computer science and his role in WWII. This includes the Turing Award, established in 1966 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and often regarded as the "Nobel Prize of Computing."

#### How was Alan Turing legally recognized by the UK government after his death?
?
In 2013, Alan Turing was granted a royal pardon by the UK government, officially absolving him of his criminal conviction for homosexuality. This act was part of a broader recognition of his contributions and a public acknowledgment of the injustice he faced.
