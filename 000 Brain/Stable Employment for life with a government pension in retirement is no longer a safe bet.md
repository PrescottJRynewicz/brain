# A life of stable employment with a government pension in retirement is no longer a safe bet.

#### Why has the WWII model of specialization, retirement at 65, and   Social Security broken down?
?
Because of the current rate and acceleration of technological advances, the career model taught to the last two generations of Americans is obsolete. Working in one specialized job for 45 years to get a sweet retirement payout will most likely leave you on your ass in 10 years if you tried it today.
