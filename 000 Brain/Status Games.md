# Status Games

Status is the primary currency of social animals. Why do we care so much about embarrassing ourselves in front of others or avoiding hard conversations? The oldest and strongest parts of our brain fear the consequences of losing social status. 


#### What type of currency does Social Status have?
?
**Positional:** Unlike wealth, health, or learning, status is purely positional. The pie size is fixed, and everyone's out to get a slice of it.

#### What type of sum game is Status?
?
Zero-sum. Because status is positional, we can only gain status at someone else's expense and vice versa.

#### What are examples of positive-sum status games?
?
**Strava:** Competing with your friends to be the fittest: gym competition is similar. Beware of diminishing returns and injury, though.
**Trivia Tournaments:** Everyone comes out on top if the goal is to challenge your friends to be the best at knowing fun and useful random facts. 
**Book Clubs:** Social and status pressure to do well in your book club is a great status game to play.
