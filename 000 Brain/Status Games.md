# Status Games

Status is the basic currency of social animals. Why do we care so much about embarrassing ourselves in front of others or avoiding hard conversations? The oldest and strongest parts of our brain fear the consequences of losing social status. 


#### What type of currency does Social Status have?
?
**Positional:** Unlike wealth, health, or learning, status is purely positional. The pie size is fixed, and everyone's out to get a slice of it.

#### What type of sum game is status?
?
Zero-sum. Because status is positional, we can only gain status at someone else's expense and vice versa.
