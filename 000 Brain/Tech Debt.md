# Tech Debt
I think a lot about tech debt, probably because "tech debt" often causes someone pain or annoyance. I share this sentiment. I have often been upset by some technology or software. 

Tech debt is too broad of a term, though. I recently found  [this article](https://kellanem.com/notes/towards-an-understanding-of-technical-debt), which speaks well to the overuse and lack of understanding of what tech debt actually is. Kellan breaks down tech debt into five categories. Below is my own interpretation of these categories
1. [[Maintenance]]
2. [[High Inertia Code]]
3. [[High Inertia Operations]]
4. Code choices that suck the will to live
	1. I think this is also included in high inertia code
5. [[Dependencies management]]
