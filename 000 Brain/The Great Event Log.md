# The Great Event Log

I have a dichotomy in prajna. My intense emotional self is unconcerned with data - feeling is the most valuable metric. How does an experience, a song, a product, or an essay make me feel. 

The opposite voice in my ahead is obsessed with facts and figures. Using data to prove something as truthful, and having access to immense, flexible data stores to draw insights.  


These two sides create different desires. The analytic side wants access a universal log of all events in my life. Every keystroke on my laptop and phone, every purchase I've made, every workout I've completed, every conversation I have had. The emotional side wants the tools to combine those data points into art, insight, and revelation. 


The analytical craving has a clear solution. Implement a time series database with a flexible event schema to understand what you have done in your life. 

The emotional side isn't as clear. How can data be expressed in impactful and interesting ways?

This leads us to a how might we. If we have access to a complete event log of our life, how might we utilize this information to impact our lives?

1. Spotify yearly wrap up style 
	1. Show trends in your life that will most likely be surprising.
2. Prajna
	1. Show you how much you actually do vs the story you create about yourself.
3. Visualization's
	1. Show the impact of your choices by visualizing outputs. 


#### Other Possibilties
I have wanted to create some kind of timeline on my website, that represents a series of significant events in my life. I want the visuals to look beautiful, and evoke the feeling of time growth and passing time. 

##### How might we visualize the passing of time and highlight stories along the way? 

**3D Dots**
Close dots are big, far dots are small. Dots are rotated and employ shadows to appear on the ground with a fixed light source. Scrolling, will change the size of each dot, and the contents of the background. 

**Tree**
Roots represent my inalienable traits. Large sections of the tree breakaway early, and form the main tenants of my evolving self. 


##### How might we continue to add to the story, without significant overhead?
