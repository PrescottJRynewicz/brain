# The Lizard Brain and Their Friends

Our brains are a product of millions of years of evolution. There are multiple pieces with very different functions. 

The Lizard brain is the oldest and strongest part of our brain. It keeps us safe and drives everything we need to survive. The exponential growth of technology has made our cerebrum much more valuable than our lizard brain, but it is playing with a severe handicap. It is the underdog, and we all love an underdog story.

#### What are the four primary groups in the brain?
?
ï»¿**Limbic System - the lizard brain:**  Anger, revenge, sex and fear.
**Brain Stem:** breathing and other unconscious survival functions
ï»¿**Cerebellum:** coordination and motor control 
ï»¿**Cerebrum:** the newest and most sophisticated part of our brain. Logic, learning, emotional regulation. Is always overruled by the other three parts.
