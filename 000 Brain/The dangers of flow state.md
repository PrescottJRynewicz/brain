# The dangers of flow state

Flow state is great. 

But

Once you’re in flow - you putting on blinders. Strategic big picture thinking doesn’t happen in flow (at least it doesn’t for me).

Flow can be internally and externally motivated.

If the motivation to stay in flow is strong enough, your ability to make clear, strategic decisions diminishes. 


Some people might think of flow state as gently gliding, ebbing and weaving with the curve of the path. 

I would describe it as a frictionless hill. Once you get going, it is incredibly difficult to stop. 

#### Example

I was too heads down trying to get Cypress to work for superbud. I didn't set a clear goal to clarify my direction. 

I wasted a few hours writing a command like this
```
"test:e2e:run": "touch tsconfig.copy.json && cp tsconfig.json tsconfig.copy.json && cp cypress/tsconfig.json tsconfig.json && start-server-and-test start http://localhost:3000 test:cypress && cp tsconfig.copy.json tsconfig.json && rm tsconfig.copy.json",
```

When the fix was a one-line change in the tsconfig file.
