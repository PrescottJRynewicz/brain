# To Be there

#### Story
A short story about Chase and my friendship, losing John, filling the space with the unhealthy love of stupid young relationships, and focused hobby's. 

Being lost, alone, and unable to move forward.

Finding your way back, and the meaning in life. 

### Story Board
1. Water fountain in second grade - Chase was there. 
2. Doing things together
	1. Basketball team at Calvary Church
	2. Jumping off of home made jump in Chase's backyard
	3. Our infinite war against the Nazi Zombies
3. Descriptions of their personalities
	1. Chase - somewhat of a hard shell to crack, but very deep once you've opened it. Chase punching me in the head because I won knock out. Being home sick when having sleep over's
	2. Prescott - a little too driven to succeed, and focused on sports, music, and school. Stoic but empty. Never feeling comfortable, trying to find the feeling of family and home. 
4. Glory days of Union Middle School
	1. Leadership
	2. Volleyball team
5. The slow and natural separation of High School - Chase was there, and I wasn't. 
	1. Having first GF and intense focus on music 
	2. Chase playing volleyball
	3. John leaving accelerates the spiral
	4. I remember thinking - "maybe this could be my new home." Highly illogical, as is our most tender and vulnerable selves.
	5. Blaming my friends for not being driven, that's why were not close. Wishing they could know how I felt, and craving friendship; the kind where sitting quietly for two hours together is a lovely afternoon.
6. Rock bottom at the beginning of UCLA
	1. Everyone talks about walking in someone else's shoes, but there is no walking when the strong, sweeping waves of fear, anxiety, and loneliness, leave you crippled, shaking in bed for 3 days straight. 
7. Crawling back up
