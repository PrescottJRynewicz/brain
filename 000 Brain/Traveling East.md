# Traveling East

A story about me and John's relationship. 

My earliest memories of him being around the house. 

How he taught me to shave. How he exemplified passion. Inspired travel, curiosity, and play. He watched Lord of the Rings with me, and came to every baseball game and music performance. I talked to him when I was scared about the lightning bolts of hormonal pain striking my pubescent scrotum.
Traveling to Europe, buying tin flutes, and learning how to play the closing song of the third movie "Into the West"

John became the most important parental figure in my life. 

Starting high school. Acne and anxiety start to set in. Going outside to see others becomes an intense act of daily emotional labor. It is easy to hide behind goals, activities, and success. Anxiety creates a dense fog, trapping you where you are, and clouding judgment. 

The evolving emotional and logical parts of my brain continue to develop, exposing the deep cracks in both of my families. 


Relationships at both houses get stressed, and a deeper hatred for moving every 3 days sets in. 

Find the ability to escape home and create a new life by joining the drum corps. This leaves me absent from time at home, and relationships with all parents start to fade.

A simple and somber conversation in the kitchen of our once-family home. The setting was too beautiful for it's current content. I didn't know what to feel, and I didn't feel anything. Anxiety continued to trap my vision past a few feet in front of me. 

The morning arrives. John has set the date to drive cross-country to live in his hometown where his biological children live. Breakfast is planned before his departure, but Prescott wakes to find a note at John's seat of the table. He reads the letter, without understanding any of it's contents. 

John couldn't bare to say goodbye to the family he didn't want to leave. Leaving was easier for him than facing the goodbye. 

Prescott locked himself in his room, looking out his window to the empty parking spot of John's car. The faint lyrics of "into the west" ring through Prescott's head until evening.

Use a visual of Palos Verdes. Itâ€™s a magical cove, that appears to trail off into the end of the world.
