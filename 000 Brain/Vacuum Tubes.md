# Vacuum Tubes

#### What is a Vacuum Tube?
?
A vacuum tube is a simple circuit element from the mid-19th century. In it's simplest form, it consists of three elements in a vacuum.
1. Cathode - heated element that emits electrons (and glows)
2. Anode - positive plate attracting the electrons
3. Control Grid (plate) - a metal element between the anode and cathode that modulates the flow of electrons by controlling it's negative charge
For example - to use a vacuum tube to amplify sound, you would plug the input audio signal into the control grid, and that signal, along with a master volume control, would vary the negative charge of the control grid. If the master volume was maxed out, the plate would have no negative charge, and the original audio signal would be amplified by the amount of electrons being emitted by the cathode.

#### What are the standard wattages for Vacuum Tubes?
?
PreAmp Tubes - 1 Watt or less
Power Amp Tubes - 2-25 Watts
Large Power Tubes - Up to 400W

#### How Does a solid-state amplifier work? 
?
It's all transistors baby. 
Either a Field Effect Transistor (voltage) or a Bipolar junction transistor (current) take in a large supply of current or voltage, and then module that by another input audio signal and a master volume control, which increases or decreases the amount of the initial power supply that makes it through.
