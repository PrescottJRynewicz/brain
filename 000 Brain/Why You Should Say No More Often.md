# Why You Should Say No More Often

This is a very common topic in work improvement culture. There are [plenty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RexdAmTVGh4&ab_channel=TimFerriss) of good articles about why you say no more often. 


Most of the time, this advice applies to managers, leaders, and people whose time is stressed. I would argue that this applies to all people. 

All of our best ideas come when we are not working, and when we have created space for diffuse thinking. This is especially true for uniquely creative ideas, that cannot be replicated by others. (Add quote from Full Engagement). 

If you want to be good at following the rules and having others created systems for your life, then this is not important. But if you want to accept the challenge to create your own rules to live by, and have the potential for unbounded growth that somebody else can define or restrain you to, you have to learn when and how to say no. This applies for everyone: CEOs and entry level sales people. 

**Rules**
If you work for an organization that doesn't value this - don't work there. It is better to spend the time finding a job that does value this instead of working towards prestige or other vanity metrics. 

Diffuse thinking can have a schedule - but that schedule must exclude interrupting activities. Walking, reading, working out etc... are all good examples. My most valuable ideas usually come after intense interval or weight training. For example, I wrote the speech for my best friends wedding at the top of a mountain in the middle of a cycling workout. I had no intention to write this, but at the peak of my adrenaline high, I had to choice to stop my ride, and put down my thoughts. It was one of the most emotional and creative performances I have ever had, and it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't taken a break to ride my bike, rest my brain, and stress my body.
