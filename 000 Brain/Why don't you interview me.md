# Why don't you interview me?

Hiring idea - have the interviewer come up with an interview question to interview the interviewer. Probably would only work for small companies. 


Hiring is very difficult. Finding someone with a technical craft to meet our needs is already hard enough. Hiring someone who meets all their technical requirements, and has the social, emotional, and creative skills to create far more value than their salary is almost impossible (and those people are extremely difficult to find.)

How do you foster the growth of that type of person internally?

1. Have people solve hard problems
2. Have everyone lead
3. Have everyone make decisions
