# You are not a Boss

It is not your job to be someone‚Äôs boss. It is your job to be everyone‚Äôs partner.

Boss = fear tactics, power dynamics, and telling people what to do

Partner = support system, caretaker, thought partner.

Because you are technically someone‚Äôs manager, why does that make you ‚Äúin charge‚Äù or ‚Äúright‚Äù?.

Good ideas win.

Clear and honest communication wins.

Equal opportunity wins.

Clear decision-making and low thrash execution wins.

The boss makes decisions and the boss delegates specific tasks to people underneath them. 

The partner gives highly valuable editorial feedback, supports their partner in their decisions, pumps them up when things go well, and lifts them from the ground when they fall (and helps them learn to fall less). 

Creating a team of independent, creative decision-makers is the combination of the most effective and efficient organization. It will be scary to release control, especially for natural leaders with strong opinions, clear vision, and relevant experience telling them things *should* work a certain way, but it is impossible to build a successful team without spreading the opportunity of decision making to every level of your organization.
