# You are not a Boss

It is not your job to be someone’s boss. It is your job to be everyone’s partner.

Boss = fear tactics, power dynamics, and telling people what to do

Partner = support system, caretaker, thought partner.

Just because you are technically someone’s manager, why does that make you the one “in charge” or “right”?.

Good ideas win.

Clear and honest communication wins.

Equal opportunity wins.

Clear decision making, and low thrash execution wins.
