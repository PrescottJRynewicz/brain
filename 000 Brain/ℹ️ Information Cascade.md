# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information Cascade

What is an information cascade?
?
This is when we humans use data from other humans to make decisions in a snowball affect. "They did this, so I did this, which made someone else do this." 
##### **This is especially dangerous when there was no initial truth, information, or understood assumptions.** 
i.e. A runaway auction for a the contents of a secret box. 
##### **Takeaway**: If using info from other people, make sure to understand why they are doing what they are doing. Otherwise, you introduce inherit other peoples mistakes and assumptions
