# ‚ÜòÔ∏è The Law of Diminishing Returns

#### What is the law of diminishing returns? 
?
The decrease in marginal output of a production process as the amount of a single factor of production is incrementally increased.
Almost everything in life follows this principle. 
The same amount of water helps a baby tree grow much more than a full grown tree.
More money is extremely helpful when you're 18, and not helpful at all when your wealthily retired. 
You can double your bench press in your first month of lifting, then it might take another year to add 25%.
**Everything will plateau, and some things will even start to go negative (overtraining)**.
