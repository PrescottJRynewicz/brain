#### What is a mathematical integral? 
?
An integral is the area under a curve. 
For example: the definite integral of velocity will give you distance travelled. The definite integral of acceleration will give you the change in velocity over a period of time.

#### What is the difference between a definite and indefinite integral?
?
Definite integrals have constant upper and lower bounds and will result in a number value. Indefinite integrals do not have constant bounds, and answer the question, *What function gives f(x) when differentiated?*
