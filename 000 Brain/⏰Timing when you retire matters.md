# ‚è∞Timing when you retire matters

#### What is a 401K? 
?
There are two types. **Traditional** and **Roth**. They differ slightly depending on how they interact with your taxable income. 
Both are investment funds, typically made up of mutual funds and target-date funds. But they can also include more interesting items like [ICGs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guaranteedinvestmentcontract.asp) or company stock.

#### What are the two types of 401K, and how are they different?
?
Traditional and Roth. 
**Roth:** You contribute **after-tax** dollars. When you take money out, it is not taxable income
**Traditional:** You contribute **pre-tax** dollars, and when money taken out, it is treated as taxable income.

#### Why does timing matter for your Retirement? 
?
Because of compound interest and the stock market. 
Because your 401K is an investment fund, if the market tanks the year you retire, your account could be destroyed. While it's losing money from the market, you are also taking significant amounts of money out. Once the market recovers, you have now lost a significant amount of financial power because of compound interest. If you make 10% on half your original retirement account, it is not going to recover to make sure you have enough money for end of life. 
This is not an issue with other accounts where money is held and you keep adding to it. Theoretically, a crash is good, because when you invest during a crash you will earn a killing when the market recovers. 
Here is an example image of how the same retirement account could perform depending on the year you retired

My actual thoughts on this is that the typical retirement plan is out of date. It is much more worthwhile to take multiple mini-retirements while continuing to find work that you love as you mature and age.
