# ☠️ Managing Difficult or Toxic Relationships

The last two weekends (Aug 19-27, 2023) have been very fun, and very challenging. The first weekend was Kevin's 30th birthday in Cabo and the second was Pi Chi's 9th Fantasy Football Destination Draft. While both weekends had very fun moments, each weekend contained enough anxiety to make me question if either trip was "worth" going on. 

Simply put: I feel significant anxiety managing relationships and group dynamics with extended Pi Chi.

Here are some examples that trigger my anxiety

1. Lack of empathy
	1. Kevin and Giff excessively peer pressuring Jacob into going out with them.
2. Lac of social awareness
	1. Kevin leaving to do dishes during Hot Seat, the most valuable and connecting activity over the weekend.
	2. Kevin and Andy interjecting with personal thoughts and connections during Hot Seat, instead of listening. 
	3. Joking group dynamic: inability to deal with more serious conversations. 
3. Chaotic energy leading to injury and issue: Masculine dominance and competition
	1. Kevin dropping Kyle into a wine barrel in Austin
	2. Kyle hurting people because he think's it's funny.
		1. Me getting literally blisters on my ass from being slapped so hard.
4. Poor Communication Skills
	1. Missed assumptions, poor listening skills, distracted by phones/content.
5. Excessing drinking and substance abuse (along with peer pressure to engage)
	1. I don't care about other people doing that, but the group dynamic centering around it is not enjoyable for me.
6. Non-stop high volume music
	1. It's just annoying
7. Lack of respect
	1. Staying up past 4AM multiple nights in a row, including excessively loud music, screaming, banging furniture, and air-playing music to bedroom TVs where people were sleeping. 

## Assumptions

1. Our current trips drain more energy and cause more anxiety than they are worth for me. Not by a large margin, but I haven't left the last few drafts feeling anxious, drained, and resentful instead of fulfilled and full of love for my friends.
2. Despite point 1, the group and individual relationships are worth maintaining: I care about everyone in Pi Chi.
3. If I don't do something, I don't the group dynamic will change. 

#### What can I do to improve group trips that cause me anxiety?
?
1. Book trips with multiple buildings on a property so that there are quiet and party areas
2. Help plan trip activities to avoid the default associative regressions to drinking, substance abuse, and overly masculine activities. 
3. Bring S/Os on the trips with us.
4. Have a conversation with everyone in the group to let them know how I feel. 
	1. It will be very difficult, but it would be worth scheduling some time with everybody to let them know how I feel.
