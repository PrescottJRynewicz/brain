# ‚öñÔ∏è Scalable vs. Non-Scalable Careers

#### What is a Scalable vs. Non-Scalable Career?
?
**Non-Scalable:** What we think of as a regular job. There is no asymmetric upside. You get paid for the work you do. Generally stable.
**Scalable**: Artists. Anything that involves you creating a path to asymmetric upside. Subject to [[ü¶¢ Black Swan Events]], [[üîã Power Law Distribution]], high volatility, and can have gigantic outsized returns‚Äîauthors, musicians, company founders, etc.

#### What are some strategies for creating a scalable career?
? 
The goal is to spend as much time being an artist as possible. Exploring work you love to do, and using [[Effectuation]] to take advantage of opportunities as they are presented to do art. The hard part is that it is usually very time and energy-intensive to do this, and you won't get paid upfront. So we need a method to give ourselves this freedom to explore, without increasing the chances of ruining ourselves now or later. 
##### Barbell Strategy
Continue exploring while having a day job. Ideally, the day job is mundane and leaves the majority of your creative resources available for your nonworking hours. The best option for this would probably be a high-paying part-time gig, like a profiled security guard working a few nights a week.

##### Serial Barbell Strategy
Devote areas of complete focus to either exploring or exploiting.

#### What is the failure mode when creating a scalable career?
?
The starving artist. Trying to jump directly to the high-risk end of the spectrum without creating a safety net, diversified skills, etc...
Some people may disagree with this, saying that you will only succeed in something truly spectacular with a safety net. But I believe this opinion is subject to [[ü•á Survivorship Bias]], and the fact that for most people, a life spent comfortably exploring, even if they don't experience a positive black swan event, is still a life worth living. It would be amazing to have an inspired marketer co-worker who wrote a full-length book on the American political divide and founded a non-profit.
