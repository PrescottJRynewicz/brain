# 🌀The benefits of skill diversity

Talk about the benefits of skill diversity, and how it has benefited my life. 
1. More malleable for a fast-changing economy 
2. Much more resistant to black swan events
3. Diversified self-esteem 


Examples from my life 
1. Loving to ski
2. Learning web dev while at l Lockheed 
3. Learning C++ and robotics while at Chemetry
4. Learning cycling 
5. Cooking 

All of these Diversifications create new opportunities, and chances for [[Effectuation]] to take place. They are also fun. 

Down side: learning how to balance, and not be bad at 6 things at once.
