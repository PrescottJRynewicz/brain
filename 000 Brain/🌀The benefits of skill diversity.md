# üåÄThe benefits of skill diversity

Talk about the benefits of skill diversity, and how it has benefited my life. 
1. More malleable for a fast-changing economy 
2. Much more resistant to black swan events
3. Diversified self-esteem 

Most recently, getting laid off from Cameo didn't impact my ego, self worth, or career explorations in almost any way.


Examples from my life 
1. Loving to ski
2. Learning web development while at l Lockheed 
3. Learning C++ and robotics while at Chemistry
4. Learning cycling 
5. Cooking 

All of these Diversifications create new opportunities, and chances for [[Effectuation]] to take place. They are also fun. 

Downside: learning how to balance, and not be bad at 6 things at once. 

Also - adding diversity to your life increases volume and density of the subliminal primordial goop available for you to access.


#### Stories To Tell
1. Start with an example of my life when I started college. I did not have much diversification, and was very close to rock bottom. 
	1. I did not feel like I had a family, home, or like I knew where I was going. I was in one of the most densely populated place on earth, and I was trapped by loneliness on the bottom of a bunk bed in Rieber Vista.
2. Talk about digging myself out of that hole.


### Diversification Per Category

#### Knowledge

[[The World is Changing Quickly]]

It is not good to become an expert in a highly specific field. For example, spending 10 years of your life devoted to only researching the aerodynamic affects on the tips of winglets might be a highly engaging career for that time, but may render you useless once someone else makes a different discovery and know that research is no longer needed. This is a form of blinders [[The dangers of flow state]]

Becoming an expert in a slightly broader discipline, like how to perform high quality, peer reviewed research, would be a much higher probability play to maintain options for work that are still satisfying. Becoming an expert is not an issue, but maintaining a consistent and narrow scope is a high risk high reward bet.


Knowledge also doesn't have any asymptotes. The ability for our brain to hold information is somewhat boundless, much more so than our ability to maintain social connections or get healthier. We can remember lyrics to a thousand songs, but we can't maintain 1000 best friendships. 

#### Social
Relationships are difficult. Every relationship will experience stress, misunderstanding of boundaries, and poor communication. Even your oldest and best friends may become distant at some point. 


The classic example is falling head over heels for a new romantic partner, creating distance between your friends and family, and then falling into a deep pit of despair when the relationships ends. 

Maintaining friends and actively seek connections with multiple groups may seem dirty and strange, but I believe that all relationships (other than the children you choose to have) are conditional. We all have our natural place on the selfish <-> unselfish scale, but at the end of the day, if another person is not adding something positive to your life, why would you maintain that relationship? 

#### Financial
Start with this first - this is the most straightforward dimension to diversify. Keep the majority of your finances 80-90%, in safe long standing investments. Real estate, index funds, 401K, etc...

Take the other 10% and put them towards high risk high reward payouts. 

#### Health

Do this as early as you can. You don't have cardio memory of ligament memory. You can always get improve your endurance with more regular training, and can always get more flexible with a regular stretching routine. But these both subside without use. 

Muscle memory doesn't subside. Even though I haven't played baseball in close to two decades, I still can pick up a bat and step up to the plate with a few warm up swings. I still have a vivid muscle memory of how to throw my infamous knuckle slider, my childhood friendly named "El Droppo", because it had a tendency to drop up to 5 feet after leaving my hand. 

Learn as many sports as you can at a young age (parents, please enroll your kids in sports if you have the means)

Learn the basics of weightlifting as soon as you reach a healthy age to weight lift. 

Start a stretching routine and stick with it. It will be hard initially, but it will only get easier. I am naturally infexible. i.e. I could never touch my toes growing up, and hated when my soccer coach would nag at me saying I need to stretch more. During Covid, I started strecthing every night. I would only do 3-4 stretches for 5-10 minutes, mostly focusing on my legs to recover for cycling races. Performing this ritual quickly increased my flexiblity, from not being able to touch my toes, to being able to wrap my entire palm over the bottom of my foot. 

Now, three years later, I only stretch 1-2 times a week. When I do, I am a little more stiff to begin, but within a few minutes of warming up, I can get to 90% of my previous flexibility. With a week of routine, I can regain almost 100%. 

Also, just sleep as much as you can. I do not have the pedigry to back up this opinion with data, but just do it. Anecdotally, every good day I have starts with good sleep, and the growing amount of
