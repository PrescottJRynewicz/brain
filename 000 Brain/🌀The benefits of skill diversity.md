# 🌀The benefits of skill diversity

Talk about the benefits of skill diversity, and how it has benefited my life. 
1. More malleable for a fast-changing economy 
2. Much more resistant to black swan events
3. Diversified self-esteem 

Most recently, getting laid off from Cameo didn't impact my ego, self worth, or career explorations in almost any way.


Examples from my life 
1. Loving to ski
2. Learning web development while at l Lockheed 
3. Learning C++ and robotics while at Chemistry
4. Learning cycling 
5. Cooking 

All of these Diversifications create new opportunities, and chances for [[Effectuation]] to take place. They are also fun. 

Downside: learning how to balance, and not be bad at 6 things at once. 

Also - adding diversity to your life increases the subliminal primordial goop available for you to access.
