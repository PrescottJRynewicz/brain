#### What is Hedonic Adoption?
?
The psychology theory is that every person is pre-programmed to a level of happiness. Our life and circumstances will create waves around this average, but we will eventually return to that base level.

I believe this theory in broad strokes. A new and unique event will make me extremely happy. After I have done that event 100s of times, it will become less novel, and I will crave something more or different to capture that previous feeling I had. In reverse, enough time after a traumatic breakup, and you forgot how that breakup ever felt. 
**I prefer the more liberal interpretation**: Nothing will be endlessly novel - we all become accustomed to the good and bad things in our life.
