#### What are some of the benefits of increasing muscle mass?
?
1. Higher metabolic rate
	1. Which means you can/should eat more
	2. And by eating more, you will get more vitamins/minerals
2. Reduced Insulin Sensitivity
	1. Muscles are glucose sinks
	2. This is why athletes will drink soda during performance activities - the sugar is actually good
3. Muscle Memory
	1. Unlike cardio training (unfortunately), once you develop muscle memory, it's there for life.
