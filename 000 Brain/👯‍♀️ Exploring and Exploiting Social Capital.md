# üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exploring and Exploiting Social Capital

Social capital is moderately stable but has the potential [[ü¶¢ Black Swan Events]] (deaths, falling outs, break ups) that can cause intense volatility. 

Low amplitude, high frequency, and diminishing exploration is valuable to find your chosen family and then double down on those relationships that bring value to your life.

Due to the black swan nature of social capital, it is essential to develop the following skills:

1. **Diversification:** Make sure you have more than one biological or chosen family. A biological or chosen family can be a single person, or a group of 15 friends, but you need more than one. If you only have one support system, you will be left in a dangerous place if that support system collapses.
2. **Relationship Building**: Building relationships is a muscle. Without training, its strength will fade. If you find yourself at a social loss, it is important to be able to flex this muscle to create a new, high-quality support system. Luckily, like our physical muscles, our social skills have muscle memory and will quickly return after being dormant. If you are at social capacity, it is a critical practice to put yourself into potentially uncomfortable social situations to practice communication, listening, empathy, and vulnerable connection. 


Even though Social Capital has strong diminishing returns due to [[Dunbar's Number]], it is always valuable to continue exploring new social connections throughout our lives. Outside of providing us with a positive and meaningful human experience, our social network can impact other areas of our lives that create short-term compounding effects. For example, a co-worker-turned-friend could lead to your next career move; connecting with someone on your IM team could lead you to fall in love with a new sport;  etc...
