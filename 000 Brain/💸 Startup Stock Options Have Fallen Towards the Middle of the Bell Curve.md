# ðŸ’¸ Startup Stock Options Have Fallen Towards the Middle of the Bell Curve

Young employees entering the technology world around 2015 on are told about the promises of payoff if you pick the right start ups to work for, seeing older generations who were made wealthy from their Tech Giant stock (Microsoft).  

In 2023, this promise is more widely available, less risky, but has less upside. There is a growing range of VCs willing and ready to dump investor monitor into companies for good or bad reasons, and the number of start ups that a software engineer can work at probably rivals the number of open positions at large established tech companies, and the salary pay cut to work at a start up is a much lower percentage than it used to be. 


Preferred vs Common stack, tax laws, and the fact that you still have to decide when to buy and sell your options, makes this promise much uglier than originally described. For most people to get a life-changing payoff, their startup would need to reach the almost-impossible size of existing tech giants. 

I didn't research many numbers for this (I don't have internet right now). This thought is a combination of my own experience at Cameo, and [[Richard Meadow]]'s thought's from [[ðŸ“— Optionality - Survive and Thrive#Chapter 22 Black Swan Hunting]]
