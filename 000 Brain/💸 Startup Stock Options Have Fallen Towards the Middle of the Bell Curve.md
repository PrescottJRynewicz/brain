# ðŸ’¸ Startup Stock Options Have Fallen Toward the Middle of the Bell Curve

Young employees entering the technology world around 2015 on are told about the promises of payoff if you pick the right start ups to work for, seeing older generations who were made wealthy from their Tech Giant stock (Microsoft).  

In 2023, this promise is more widely available, less risky, but has less upside. There is a growing range of VCs willing and ready to dump investor monitor into companies for good or bad reasons, and the number of start ups that a software engineer can work at probably rivals the number of open positions at large established tech companies, and the salary pay cut to work at a start up is a much lower percentage than it used to be. 


Preferred vs Common stack, tax laws, and the fact that you still have to decide when to buy and sell your options, makes this promise much uglier than originally described. For most people to get a life-changing payoff, their startup would need to reach the almost-impossible size of existing tech giants. 

I didn't research many numbers for this (I don't have internet right now). This thought is a combination of my own experience at Cameo, and [[Richard Meadow]]'s thought's from [[ðŸ“— Optionality - Survive and Thrive#Chapter 22 Black Swan Hunting]]
**Edit**: I have now done some research (linked below), and made some cards.


### Review

#### What is Growth Capital for Startups, and what effect does it have on employee stock (options)?
?
Growth capital is a fairly recent change to the Venture world. **The longer a company stays private, the more valuable it becomes.** Money that would have gone to employees and wall street now goes to the VCs and Growth Investors.
**BUT:** this means it takes much longer for a company to go public and reach a liquid event.

#### What is Reverse Vesting?
?
It is when the founders of a company receive all their stock ownership upfront. There is still a vesting period, so if the founder leaves before they have finished vesting, the company can buy back the stock at a cheap or free rate.

#### Why are Startup Stock Options less valuable now than it was a few decades ago? 
?
1. Growth Capital stage - it now takes 10-12 years for a company to go public.
	1. This also gives higher returns to the investors and lower returns to the employees. The company has to be valued much higher for the average common stockholder to do well. 
2. Because companies stay private longer and have a higher FMV while private, the cost of exercising your options can easily outweigh the risk.
3. Founders have the option to cash out early with their Restricted Stock, which breaks apart the motivation system and does put founders and employees on common footing.
