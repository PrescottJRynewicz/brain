# Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

**Definition**: Asset prices reflect all available information. 

All information available to the stock market gets incorporated into asset prices. Especially during the age of the internet, information is added to the system at an alarming rate. The ability for an individual (or a hugely wealthy hedge fund with swarms of employees and resources) to get an *edge* on the collective, is extremely unlikely.

??
Asset prices reflect all available information. Unless you have an edge (which is almost impossible to gain in the financial sector), you will not beat the mean market.
