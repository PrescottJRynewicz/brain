# 📐 Goodhart's Law
#### What is Goodhart's Law? 
??
*When a measure becomes a target, it's no longer a good measure*. 
This is an important principle to know when setting goals. *Measures of effectiveness* are much better goals than *Measures of Performance*, yet much harder to define and measure. 
The glass-half-full version of Goodhart's law is *What gets measured gets done.*
