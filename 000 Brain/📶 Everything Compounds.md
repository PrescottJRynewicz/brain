#### What is the Matthew Effect? 
?
*For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.*
I see the Matthew effect as a metaphor for gravity. Having money helps you get more money. Having friends helps you get more friends. Being in good shape makes you better at all sports. 
The reverse is also true
Having debt creates more debt. Being in one toxic relationship can destroy other relationships in your life. Being out of shape effects your mental health, which in turns makes it harder to get into shape.
