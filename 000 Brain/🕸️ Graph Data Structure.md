# Graph Data Structure 
#### What is a Graph Data Structure?
??
A nonlinear data type.
A web of nodes and edges. Each node represents a data point in the graph. Edges connect nodes to display the relationships between each node.   
A node will contain some body of information, depending on the use case of the Graph.          
An edge will at minimum connect two nodes, but can also contain information like direction, weight, and other metadata.
