# üó∫Ô∏è Why Exploring is Crucial to Maximize our Knowledge and Financial Capital

In [[üìó Optionality - Survive and Thrive]], Richard Meadows discusses the dangers of not exploring to maximize your knowledge and financial capital. They use **Local Maxima vs. Global Maxima** as a story telling tool to demonstrate the dangers of lack of exploration. 


I think this picture is incomplete, and there is even more danger than Richard discusses. My extension of his metaphor is that without continued exploration, you may not find another hill just out of site, that also has a community of people who built a funicular from the halfway point to the top.
