# 🙊 The modern financial world uses our evolutional survival traits against us

In the modern world (especially in the united states), most people's basic needs are easily met. Due to [[🏃‍♀️Hedonic Adoption]], our evolution pushes us to crave more. This is why all technological advances have been made that created our life of abundance. 

Two of these technologies we have created are currency and capitalism: they are amazing technologies to trade goods and services and create competition, but this competition is not always healthy. Currency is a false measure of success, once we have earned enough money to cover a little more than the basic, but again [[🏃‍♀️Hedonic Adoption]] pulls us and the capitalistic world towards more consumption. When coupled with [[🍾 Beware of Mimesis]], this has led the modern marketing world to leverage our human nature against us. 

Content that we can't help but scroll through, craving the top model of car when we may not even need a car at all with a Rolex to match. 

The capitalist world has amazing benefits, but it is an uphill battle. We are not programmed to win.
