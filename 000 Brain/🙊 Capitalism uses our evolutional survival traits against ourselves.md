# 🙊 The modern financial world uses our evolutional survival traits against us

Most people's basic needs are easily met in the modern world (especially in the united states). Due to [[🏃‍♀️Hedonic Adoption]], our evolution pushes us to crave more. This is why all technological advances have created our life of abundance. 

Two of these technologies we have created are currency and capitalism: they are remarkable technologies to trade goods and services and design competition, but this competition is only sometimes healthy. Currency is a false measure of success once we have earned enough money to cover a little more than the basics. Still, again [[🏃‍♀️Hedonic Adoption]] pulls us and the capitalistic world towards more consumption. Coupled with [[🍾 Beware of Mimesis]], the modern marketing world has leveraged our human nature against us. 

Content that we can't help but scroll through, craving the top model of car when we may not even need a car at all with a Rolex to match. 

The capitalist world has amazing benefits, but it is an uphill battle. We are not programmed to win.
