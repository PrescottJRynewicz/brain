# ðŸ¤• Pain is the feeling of Accelerating Information

Pain (or rough synonym for failure) is one of the best ways for us to learn. 

There is physical and mental pain, with several sub-categories of each one. Each type of pain feels very different (nerve pain, heart break, loss in competition, ego destruction, etc...). All those feelings of pain or failure provide valuable information if we allow ourselves to listen. 

I like this phrase because of the physical metaphor: physical acceleration is very fun until it's not, becoming uncomfortable to the point of demise.
