# ðŸ¦¢ Black Swan Events

#### What is a Black Swan Event?
?
A Black Swan Event (as made famous by Nassim Taleb) is an unpredictable event with the potential for devastation to a person or group.
The typical example is to look at a graph of "dead vs. alive" for the life of a swan. Just using the trend data on the graph, you could confidently bet that the swan will leave to see tomorrow. But one day, that bet will be wrong, and you could be left on your ass without a horse.
