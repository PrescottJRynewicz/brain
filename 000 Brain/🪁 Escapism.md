# 🪁 Escapism

#### What is Escapism
?
The desire to escape from reality into a storybook freedom, especially when your reality doesn't allow you the choice to escape ( [[💸 Fuck-You Money]] ). Escapism can be performed through distraction, entertainment, substances, travel, and more.

I was an Escapist at Lockheed. I hated feeling trapped underground in Palmdale. I would walk around the campus, looking to the horizon, wishing I could fly. Fly away from my desk, the rules of working for a government agency, and my brain. My favorite part of the day was my bathroom trips and the ten-minute YouTube breaks I would give myself. I eventually started following Paramotor and van conversion channels, and soon became obsessed with the escape to a free life on the road and in the sky. I hung shitty tapestries of the beach against the walls of my cubicle and posted as many pictures as possible that made me feel like I wasn't locked in an underground government basement, without an internet connection, writing code for fighter jets. This is just about the most escapist content you can watch -> https://youtu.be/rvQ9DjJNal0?si=Q4gsAyDTsIO1Npyp&t=466.
