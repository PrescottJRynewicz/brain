#### What are the four required questions to answer when performing customer interviews?
?
1. Are your customers who you think they are? 
2. Do they really have the problems you think they have? 
3. How does the customer solve this problem today? 
4. What would be required for them to switch?

#### What is a *wizard of oz* prototype?
?
It is a prototype where a real UI has a person behind it updating the data, that would otherwise be automated in a production setting.

#### What is the concierge technique for generating product ideas?
?
Acting like a concierge, and actually doing the job of someone whose problem you wish to solve. This is more than talking to them, and more than talking to CS. You actually have to do their job. Ideally this person works with you to teach you how they do their job.

#### What is the purpose of developing product prototypes? 

#### What is the purpose of developing product prototypes?
?
To tackle one or more product risks - value, usability, feasibility, or business. 
<!--SR:!2024-08-16,23,157-->

#### Can a user prototype completely mitigate value risk?
?
Most likely not. It’s easy for people to say what they want and will do something different. Having 10 people day they love the high fidelity prototype is not enough to confirm that your prototype is valuable. 
<!--SR:!2024-09-10,89,223-->

#### In product dev, list the main types of prototypes, and what they are used for?
?
1. Feasibility prototypes
	1. Developed my engineers to determine if something can be built. 
2. User prototypes. 
	1. Low to high fidelity prototypes that simulate the UX and IA of a product or feature. 
3. Live-data prototypes 
	1.  A prototype that can interact with (and **collect**) real data without taking the time or money to build a production ready solution. 
4. Hybrid
	1. A unique combination of the three above types.

#### According to Marty Cagan in his book Inspired, what are the three overarching principles of product design? 
?
1. **Risks are tackled up-front**
2. Products are defined and designed collaboratively 
3. Product dev is about **solving problems** not **implementing features.** 
<!--SR:!2024-09-05,27,150-->


#### What are the four primary risks we mitigate during product discovery? And Which is most important?
?
1. Value Risk
2. Usability risk
3. Feasability Risk
4. Business Risk
**Value Risk** is the most important. Without value, nothing else matters.  
<!--SR:!2024-09-14,85,237-->

#### What are the four questions we need to answer with product discovery? 
?
1. Will the user buy this (or choose to use it)
2. Can the user figure out how to use this?
3. Can our engineers build this? 
4. Can our stakeholders support this?
<!--SR:!2024-08-22,31,190-->

#### What is the single most important factor when building products? 
?
Having an above average team, with the necessary skills to discovery and delivery products within your vision. 
<!--SR:!2024-09-06,31,150-->


#### What is a discovery vs delivery Iteration?
?
Delivery iterations are what we normally think of when using the word `iterate` in product development. They are shipments to production that update a feature or product. 
A discovery iteration is collecting info about how to solve a problem. These can be much smaller and faster. 
<!--SR:!2024-10-21,130,243-->

#### How much faster should a discovery iteration be than a delivery iteration?
?
At least 10x people hours faster.

#### What are the four critical contributions a product manager brings to a team?
?
Deep knowledge of:
1. Your customers 
2. The data
3. Your business and stakeholders
4. Your market and industry

#### What are a few ways to test demand? 
1. Fake door test 
2. Fake landing page test 


#### What is a fake-door or fake-landing product experiment?
?
It’s a test where you create a fake entry point to a product offering, validating they people want what you are building. 
It’s important to solicit data from the users after they enter the fake door to make sure they are really serious about wanting the feature. 
<!--SR:!2024-10-19,120,257-->

#### Which comes first, a value or usability test, and why?
?
Usability. Because user’s can’t imagine how your product will work. A value test without a concrete understanding of what your product does turns into a product feature brainstorm - and users are not good at product discovery. 
<!--SR:!2024-08-19,4,177-->

#### What are some qualitative value testing techniques?
?
1. Ask them to actually put in a CC even if you don’t charge them. 
2. See if they would recommend the product to a co-worker, friend, or boss. 
3. See if they would be willing to devote significant time to use the product. 
4. Ask for their login to a competing product to complete a migration. 
<!--SR:!2024-09-15,55,197-->

#### What is the difference between qualitative and quantitative testing techniques? 
?
Qualitative is about fast learning and big insights. 
Quantitative is about proving something. 
<!--SR:!2024-10-07,108,237-->


#### Who are all the stakeholders a PM needs to work with to validate business feasibility?
?
1. Marketing
2. Sales
3. CS
4. Finance
5. Legal
6. Business development 
7. Security 
8. CEO/GM/leadership
9. Specific stakeholders for your business 
<!--SR:!2024-08-31,71,197-->


#### What is the difference between a walkthrough, product demo, and user test? 
**Walkthrough:** get feedback from a stakeholder on a prototype. Give them every opportunity to give feedback, so they can sign off on the product. 
**Product Demo:** Selling the product internally or externally to convince someone to buy or get on board. You drive, no one else does. 
**User test:** collecting qualitative info about a product. User is driving, you stay out of the way.
