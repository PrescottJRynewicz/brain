# The Storied Life Of AJ Fikry


A blurry, beautiful montage. The simple story of a bookstore ownerâ€™s unexpected loves. The pros move quickly and clearly, leaving room for the reader to imagine. 

I loved all the characters and cried like a baby through the final chapter. 

I am deeply thankful to [[Gabrielle Zevin]] for writing a lovely novel.
