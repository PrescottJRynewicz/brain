## Chapter 22: Black Swan Hunting

This chapter explores what a Black Swan is (briefly), and then discusses modern, relevant Black Swan options. The list is not exhaustive, but it does resonate with me in 2023. 

Rich outlines these options on p226 for how to evaluate an investment
1. How efficient is the market?
2. Do we have an exploitable edge?
3. Is there a large, unbounded upside? 
4. Is it an all in bet, or can we take a portfolio opinion? 


These options are used to explore black swan events like

1. Out-Of-Money Options
2. Venture Capital
3. Angel Investing
4. Startup Stock Options
5. Investing in yourself (my personal favorite)


After discussing these options, Rich describes his own investing strategy. A barbel strategy where the majority of money is invested into cheap index funds, retirement fund, and cash, while the other end is in high risk, Black Swan bets (start ups, crypto etc...)
