**Title:** Optionality: Survive and Thrive in a Volatile World
**Author:** [[Richard Meadows]]


# üìó Optionality

## Chapter 1: The Possibility Tree
A simple introduction discussing the vast difference in priority of decisions we make everyday. 

Richard introduces a term called [[Min-Maxing]] (see for more info). I don't necessarily like this term because it contradicts my own opinions, and other ideas thrown out in the book, i.e. being a generalist creates more options. Richard agues that you want to min-max on having optionality, which in itself, is also kind-of paradox. 

Richard also gives a little info about his engagement with the FIRE movement (the live frugal and retire early club), and how the key point they're missing is that they never take advantage of what they have chosen to max out (finances) - which I do agree with. 

## Chapter 2: Open Your Options
Asymmetric options. Discusses the point that we always want to be looking for options with a **capped downside and unbounded upside**, and we want to always avoid a **capped upside with an unbounded downside.**


## Chapter 3: Abundance
Essentially, we live in a time with the highest average abundance per person. This is amazing and mentally challenging. This book will talk about how we deal with the mental burden of abundance. 

## Chapter 4: The Blind Idiot God Of Evolution
This chapter introduces a few concepts about our psychology that will be referenced through the rest of the book. 

[[üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èHedonic Adoption]]
[[üëô Lifestyle Inflation]]
[[Conspicuous Consumption]]

## Chapter 5: Hedonism and Happiness
In short, the below image. 
![[Pasted image 20230811145646.png]]

Money makes us happier and gives us **options** for how to live our lives. Some pitfalls come with having too much money as well, such as what Richard calls Wire Heading (bombarding ourselves with non-stop stimulation and the complete removal of discomfort).

But, here is the caveat, happiness is a bad measure due to hedonic adoption. See the book for examples where happiness is a bad metric, and how optionality is a better statistic: Fasting is uplifting, and starving is torture.


## Chapter 6: The Four Factors of Optionality
1. Financial
2. Social
3. Knowledge
4. Health

Our goal is to have as many **high-quality** options within each of these domains.

Richard discusses a few other key ideas in the chapter. 

[[ü™≥ Bad is Stronger than Good]]
[[üì∂ Everything Compounds]]
[[‚ÜòÔ∏è The Law of Diminishing Returns]]


This chapter concludes book one and finishes with the idea that all domains of optionality are subject to exploitable asymmetric. i.e. - how to stay in the high growth phase of diminishing returns. 

## Chapter 7: Charting a Course
This chapter discusses how to chart a course to benefit your current **and future selves** (with a primary focus on our future selves). 

Delayed gratification is a skill that does not come naturally to our human evolution, we have to learn how to train it. 

The rest of the chapter is an exploration of the effectiveness of goals, and how to use them sparingly to create optionality. Goals are astonishingly effective on our human psychology, but can also create blind spots, and be manipulated ([[üìê Goodhart's Law]])

IMO: this was too long of a chapter. There were some contradicting thoughts about the positive and negative aspects of goals and not-so-clear definitions.

## Chapter 8: The Siren Song 
The chapter can be summarized as follows: "[[üôä Capitalism uses our evolutional survival traits against ourselves]]"


## Chapter 9: Tied to the Mast
We are creatures of habit. Once we have momentum, it is difficult to overcome inertia and accelerate to a new vector. 

[[üìó Optionality - Survive and Thrive#Chapter 8 The Siren Song]] shows us that the modern world is pulling and tempting us towards harmful behaviors (a 2 liter big gulp at 7/11). Once we have set those patterns in place, it is much harder to get out of them. 

To avoid this, we can tie ourselves to the mast. For example:

1. Screen out harmful stimuli
	1. Don't keep sugary, processed snacks at home. You will eat them, every time. 
2. Create the right inconveniences
	1. Don't save your CC in your computer, but a barrier between you and your unhealthy temptations. 
3. Tie your hands
	1. Create blockers so that you literally can't engage in certain unhealthy activities
	2. Put your video game controllers into a lock box.
	3. Use the [Freedom App](https://freedom.to/)
4. Increase the cost of failure
	1. Socialize your goals

Because we are creatures of habit, *"once we have the right systems in place, kicking back and doing nothing isn't just a good strategy - it's the best strategy."*

## Chapter 10: Creatures of Habit
IMO, this chapter is fairly empty. Richard discusses his dislike of trying to change habits, but, paradoxically, the importance of keystone habits, and then gives us a brief stint about his nutrition plan for exemplify how we can automate necessary choices in the possibility tree.  

There is one valuable quote To trade the constraints imposed upon you by others for constraints you impose upon yourself. Which is very similar to [[Jocko Willink]]'s *[[üí™  Discipline = Freedom]]*


## Chapter 11: Social Contagion
[[ü¶ç We Are Social Creatures]]

## Chapter 12: 
Simply a summary of the second book, with some good quotes. 

*Optionality is a systems approach. Instead of prescribing an outcome in advance, it tells ut to systematically collect asymmetric options, and see what happens.*

*Achieving a specific goal usually involves working through a chain of connected actions. If any one of the links fails, the entire chain breaks.*

*The optionality approach is a web ([[üï∏Ô∏è Graph Data Structure]]) of loosely coupled systems.*

## Chapter 13: Asymmetries in Financial Capital
This chapter is inappropriately titled. It should be really called "The Cost of Ownership, and Managing Expectations"

I agree with everything Richard discusses in the chapter, but it doesn't have much to do with Financial Capital, outside of how much it costs to buy and own expensive/cheap items. 

There is already a good summary of the chapter, which I won't repeat, on page 154. 

The main item from this chapter is the [[üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBarbell Strategy]]

## Chapter 14: Asymmetries in Financial Capital


## Chapter 21: Investing for the Bone Idle

[[üíπ Efficient Market Hypothesis]] 

## Chapter 22: Black Swan Hunting

This chapter explores what a Black Swan is (briefly), and then discusses modern, relevant Black Swan options. The list is not exhaustive, but it does resonate with me in 2023. 

Rich outlines these options on p226 for how to evaluate an investment
1. How efficient is the market?
2. Do we have an exploitable edge?
3. Is there a large, unbounded upside? 
4. Is it an all-in bet, or can we take a portfolio opinion? 


These options are used to explore black swan events like

1. Out-Of-Money Options
2. Venture Capital
3. Angel Investing
4. Startup Stock Options
5. Investing in yourself (my personal favorite)


After discussing these options, Rich describes his investing strategy. A barbell strategy where the majority of money is invested into cheap index funds, retirement funds, and cash, while the other end is in high-risk, Black Swan bets (start-ups, crypto, etc...)

This is a good reference chapter to get a breakdown of one type of personal financial and investing model. 

## Chapter 23: Beware of Geeks Bearing Formulas 
The main point of this chapter is that historical data is not a good reference point for understanding future market performance. 

Also, -> [[‚è∞Timing when you retire matters]].

The info about retirement funds and individual truth of retirement accounts, but I agree with a closing Caveat Richard makes "The only truly safe strategy is to maintain diverse income streams, without relying on investment returns. Ideally, that means finding work you actively enjoy, and creating a life you don't need to retire from."
