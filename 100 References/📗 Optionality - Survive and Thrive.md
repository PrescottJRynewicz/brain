**Title:** Optionality: Survive and Thrive in a Volatile World
**Author:** [[Richard Meadows]]


# üìó Optionality

## Chapter 1: The Possibility Tree
A simple introduction discussing the vast difference in priority of decisions we make everyday. 

Richard introduces a term called [[Min-Maxing]] (see for more info). I don't necessarily like this term because it contradicts my own opinions, and other ideas thrown out in the book, i.e. being a generalist creates more options. Richard agues that you want to min-max on having optionality, which in itself, is also kind-of paradox. 

Richard also gives a little info about his engagement with the FIRE movement (the live frugal and retire early club), and how the key point they're missing is that they never take advantage of what they have chosen to max out (finances) - which I do agree with. 

## Chapter 2: Open Your Options
Asymmetric options. Discusses the point that we always want to be looking for options with a **capped downside and unbounded upside**, and we want to always avoid a **capped upside with an unbounded downside.**


## Chapter 3: Abundance
Essentially, we live in a time with the highest average abundance per person. This is amazing and mentally challenging. This book will talk about how we deal with the mental burden of abundance. 

## Chapter 4: The Blind Idiot God Of Evolution
This chapter introduces a few concepts about our psychology that will be referenced through the rest of the book. 

[[üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èHedonic Adoption]]
[[üëô Lifestyle Inflation]]
[[Conspicuous Consumption]]

## Chapter 5: Hedonism and Happiness
In short, the below image. 
![[Pasted image 20230811145646.png]]

Money makes us happier and gives us **options** for how to live our lives. Some pitfalls come with having too much money as well, such as what Richard calls Wire Heading (bombarding ourselves with non-stop stimulation and the complete removal of discomfort).

But, here is the caveat, happiness is a bad measure due to hedonic adoption. See the book for examples where happiness is a bad metric, and how optionality is a better statistic: Fasting is uplifting, and starving is torture.


## Chapter 6: The Four Factors of Optionality
1. Financial
2. Social
3. Knowledge
4. Health

Our goal is to have as many **high-quality** options within each of these domains.

Richard discusses a few other key ideas in the chapter. 

[[ü™≥ Bad is Stronger than Good]]
[[üì∂ Everything Compounds]]
[[‚ÜòÔ∏è The Law of Diminishing Returns]]


This chapter concludes book one and finishes with the idea that all domains of optionality are subject to exploitable asymmetric. i.e. - how to stay in the high growth phase of diminishing returns. 

## Chapter 7: Charting a Course
This chapter discusses how to chart a course to benefit your current **and future selves** (with a primary focus on our future selves). 

Delayed gratification is a skill that does not come naturally to our human evolution, we have to learn how to train it. 

The rest of the chapter is an exploration of the effectiveness of goals, and how to use them sparingly to create optionality. Goals are astonishingly effective on our human psychology, but can also create blind spots , and be manipulated ([[üìê Goodhart's Law]])

IMO: this was too long of a chapter. There were some contradicting thoughts about the positive and negative aspects of goals and not-so-clear definitions.

## Chapter 8: The Siren Song 
The chapter can be summarized as follows: "[[üôä Capitalism uses our evolutional survival traits against ourselves]]"


## Chapter 9: Tied to the Mast
We are creatures of habit. Once we have momentum, it is difficult to overcome inertia and accelerate to a new vector. 

[[üìó Optionality - Survive and Thrive#Chapter 8 The Siren Song]] shows us that the modern world is pulling and tempting us towards harmful behaviors (a 2 liter big gulp at 7/11). Once we have set those patterns in place, it is much harder to get out of them. 

To avoid this, we can tie ourselves to the mast. For example:

1. Screen out harmful stimuli
	1. Don't keep sugary, processed snacks at home. You will eat them every time. 
2. Create the right inconveniences
	1. Don't save your CC in your computer, but a barrier between you and your unhealthy temptations. 
3. Tie your hands
	1. Create blockers so that you literally can't engage in certain unhealthy activities
	2. Put your video game controllers into a lock box.
	3. Use the [Freedom App](https://freedom.to/)
4. Increase the cost of failure
	1. Socialize your goals

Because we are creatures of habit, *"once we have the right systems in place, kicking back and doing nothing isn't just a good strategy - it's the best strategy."*

## Chapter 10: Creatures of Habit
This chapter is fairly empty. Richard discusses his dislike of trying to change habits, but, paradoxically, the importance of keystone habits, and then gives us a brief stint about his nutrition plan for exemplify how we can automate necessary choices in the possibility tree.  

There is one valuable quote To trade the constraints imposed upon you by others for constraints you impose upon yourself. Which is very similar to [[Jocko Willink]]'s *[[üí™  Discipline = Freedom]]*


## Chapter 11: Social Contagion
[[ü¶ç We Are Social Creatures]]

## Chapter 12: 
Simply a summary of the second book, with some good quotes. 

*Optionality is a systems approach. Instead of prescribing an outcome in advance, it tells ut to systematically collect asymmetric options, and see what happens.*

*Achieving a specific goal usually involves working through a chain of connected actions. If any one of the links fails, the entire chain breaks.*

*The optionality approach is a web ([[üï∏Ô∏è Graph Data Structure]]) of loosely coupled systems.*

## Chapter 13: Asymmetries in Financial Capital
This chapter is inappropriately titled. It should be really called "The Cost of Ownership, and Managing Expectations"

I agree with everything Richard discusses in the chapter, but it doesn't have much to do with Financial Capital, outside of how much it costs to buy and own expensive/cheap items. 

There is already a good summary of the chapter, which I won't repeat, on page 154. 

The main item from this chapter is the [[üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBarbell Strategy]]

## Chapter 14: Asymmetries in Health Capital
This chapter is more direct than the last chapter. It does focus on asymmetries in health capital, and it was one of the more interesting chapters in the book (for me). 

I have always had a strong connection to fitness and health, but have not given it a lot of strategic thought recently. This chapter outlined a few key insights for me. 

First off:
1. **Bad is much stronger than good in the health domain.** 
2. **You cannot be SUPER healthy, like you can be SUPER smart or SUPER rich.**
3. **Everything compounds**

With these three assumptions, it is important to figure out a system that works for you to gain momentum with your physical, health, and then understand how to maintain that. 

Richard argues that once you figure out that system, you would set it and forget it. I don't totally agree. I think variation in exercise type is important for both continued growth, and mental stimulation, to avoid the risk of gaining negative momentum. 

Another key insight that I did not know is that *[[üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Heavy resistance training has a much higher ROI than cardio training]]* (see for more info).

Interesting, this chapter also introduces the [[Lindy Effect]]


## Chapter 15: Asymmetries in Social Capital
Social capital is the domain that comes most naturally to me. The lessons in this chapter are good, but not surprising to me. Here are my key takeaways. 

1. Relationships are conditional
	1. Outside of the kids you choose to parent, all other relationships are up to your discretion. Toxic people should be cut out and avoided. Boundaries should be set.
2. *A social support net is an insurance policy against black swans.*
3. Invest in your oldest and most stable relationships first. 
	1. Family and friends are [[Lindy Effect]] approved. 
4. Investing in talented, underrated people is an interesting asymmetric option
	1. Trying to become close with Beyonce will not work. The likelihood you can provide something valuable to her is almost zero.
	2. Supporting and investing in your up-and-coming people, has a very small bounded downside for you, and an extremely large unbounded upside if you play your cards right and get lucky. (kind of like a [[Social Talent Scout]]). 


## Chapter 16: Asymmetries in Knowledge Capital 
##### According to Nielsen, how many hours of TV does the average American watch per week? 
?
34 hours ü§Ø
10 weeks in a year
<!--SR:!2023-10-28,44,250-->

This chapter is solid. It discusses the huge opportunity for unbounded upside in Knowledge Capital, and tactics to employ this. This chapter is the reason I am writing this down right now. 

Here are a few key takeaways from this chapter. 

1. [[üßÆ Option Pricing Model]]
2. There are non-negotiable knowledge capital skills
	1. Physical Health
	2. Self Care
	3. Budgeting and net worth
3. Talent Stacks
	1. Using your inherent interests, you can invest in creating a unique talent stack for you that no one else can replicate
	2. The real question is - how much is this talent stack worth
4. Reading high-quality books is the cheapest asymmetric option in the knowledge domain.
5. Compounding interest applies to learning
	1. That is why this note exists - I am trying to get a compounding return on my unique thoughts



## Chapter 17: A Fate Worse Than Debt
Very short chapter with a simple message: debt is second only to death, and complete loss of health. 

This is more nuanced in reality, but avoiding crushing debt is a must, and spiraling debt can lead to the risk of ruin. 

## Chapter 18: The Peril and Promise of Leverage

Leverage in investing is taking on debt to invest. When you buy a house and take an $800,000 loan from the Bank, that is leverage. The lower your down payment, the more leverage you have. 

Leverage can give you huge multiply factors if you know what you're doing. For example, if you buy a million-dollar home with a 50K down payment, the bank lent you 950K. So you technically have 19x leverage on your down payment. If the housing markets sky rockets and your home is worth 1.5M, you just 10x your money, made 500K, without doing any work outside of taking on financial risk. 

The opposite is also possible. This is what happened in the 2008 housing crash. Interests rates were so low, that many people were taking out high-leverage loans on houses, and people without the appropriate credit scores in income were getting loads. When housing prices began to fall, it meant these high-leverage loans were going to lose big. 


## Chapter 19: The Risk of Ruin
There are a wide array of known and unknown events that can ruin our lives - financially, socially, physically, etc...

At all costs, we need to avoid this type of ruin. Although this is scary, especially unknown Black Swan events, there are a few simple strategies to avoid this. 

1. Have all the insurance
	1. Health
	2. Travel
	3. Loss of Income
2. Have optionality 
	1. If one of your options, even your largest one, is suddenly, obsolete, make sure you options have something else to fall back on.
3. Emergency Funds
	1. No matter, keep a few months of money in an easily accessible account if shit totally hits the fan.


## Chapter 20: Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained

[[üîº Making Exponential Growth Intuitive]]
[[üê¢ Why You Can't Store Money in a Static Account]]

*Compound Interest is the most powerful force in the universe.*

## Chapter 22: Black Swan Hunting

This chapter explores what a Black Swan is (briefly), and then discusses modern, relevant Black Swan options. The list is not exhaustive, but it does resonate with me in 2023. 

Rich outlines these options on p226 for how to evaluate an investment
1. How efficient is the market?
2. Do we have an exploitable edge?
3. Is there a significant, unbounded upside? 
4. Is it an all-in bet, or can we take a portfolio opinion? 


These options are used to explore black swan events like

1. Out-Of-Money Options
2. Venture Capital
3. Angel Investing
4. Startup Stock Options
5. Investing in yourself (my personal favorite)


After discussing these options, Rich describes his investing strategy. A barbell strategy where the majority of money is invested into cheap index funds, retirement funds, and cash, while the other end is in high-risk, Black Swan bets (start-ups, crypto, etc...)

This is a good reference chapter to summarize one personal financial and investing model type. 

## Chapter 23: Beware of Geeks Bearing Formulas 
The main point of this chapter is that there are better reference points for understanding future market performance than historical data. 

Also, -> [[‚è∞Timing when you retire matters]].

The info about retirement funds and individual truth of retirement accounts, but I agree with Caveat Richard's closing: "The only truly safe strategy is to maintain diverse income streams, without relying on investment returns. Ideally, that means finding work you enjoy and creating a life you don't need to retire from."


## Chapter 24: A Time to Explore and A Time To Exploit
This chapter deeply satisfies my math brain. Richard lays out some simple charts for each domain of our life and how we want to maximize the area under the curve for each one. 

Health and Social capital are easy to summarize into charts with integrals, but knowledge and finance are not (because they are susceptible to much more volatility.)

[[üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Exploring and Exploiting Health Capitol]]
[[üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exploring and Exploiting Social Capital]]

## Chapter 25: A Time to Improvise and a Time To Exploit

This chapter has a similar thesis to [[üî© Linchpin]], but argues that optionality is the best solution to a volatile world, instead of "artistry". I think both solutions end up being somewhat similar, and require us to be much more creative and explorative than our previous generations. 

[[Stable Employment for life with a government pension in retirement is no longer a safe bet]]
[[Effectuation]]


## Chapter 26: A Time to Take Risks and A Time To Play It Safe

This is the chapter where the plane starts lining up for the runway. I would argue that most people reading this book are motivated by the idea of asymmetric outcomes: playing smarter, not harder. 

This chapter discusses a few specific strategies to create opportunities for outsized upside. 

[[‚öñÔ∏è Scalable vs Non-Scalable Careers]]


## Chapter 27: A Time to Obey and a Time to Rebel
[[Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.]]

This chapter starts with a summary of [[üí™  Discipline = Freedom]]. We have a high fulfillment potential when we create our own constraints, but our lives can quickly be ruined by living under other people's constraints. i.e. slavery versus choosing to found a vineyard. 

[[üí∏ Fuck-You Money]]


## Chapter 28: A Time to Open Options And A Time To Give Them Away

This chapter is a deeper exploration of [[üí™  Discipline = Freedom]], and how our modern world is creating a unique trend towards Workism - quoting [[Derek Thompson]]. 

Richard talks about how "Work is... good, actually?", and how successful people with the means not to work choose to work more because they love it. 

There is also a discussion on [[ü™Å Escapism]] for the people who have not found a form of work that aligns with their core motivations and brings them deep satisfaction.

[[Effective Altruism]]


## Chapter 30: Status Games
[[Status Games]]
[[Game Theory]]

This chapter attempts to demonstrate that 
1. Our biology requires us to play status games.
2. If we have to play games, don't play negative sum games. 
	1. Even though the pool of status is fixed, there are many mini-games inside of the pool that may not be negative sum.
3. Human cooperation (our ability to feel empathy) allows to coordinate for the greater good. This coordination does not always create positive-sum outputs, but if we can develop more strategies for positive-sum coordination, we can leave the world a better place than we found it.
