# The Power Of Full Engagement

## Chapter 1

Managing energy, not time, is the key to performance. 

Time per day is fixed, energy is not. 

The average energy requirement for a full time information work is insane, much more so than what we expect of professional athletes. 


#### Four Principles of Energy Management
**One**
Four sources of energy
1. Physical 
2. Emotional 
3. Mental 
4. Spiritual (knowing our deepest selves, and what is most sacred to us.)

**Two**
Rest is just as important as energy use. 
Balance is key - too much use, and we overtrain and burn out. Not enough use, and we atrophy. 

**Three**
To increase energy capacity, we must train.

**Four**
Positive energy rituals are the key to sustaining and managing energy. 

#### Purpose, Truth, Action
In order to make changes, we need to have a connection to our most deeply held values. 

Truth is easier said than done. Others usually have a much more realistic view of how we are acting. 

"Our ability to fully engage depends on our ability to periodically disengage."

What is the difference between pleasure and satisfaction?
We can experience pleasure without health and stress, or use it energy. But it’s almost impossible to have true enjoyment without making short-term sacrifices for long-term gains.

## Chapter 2


#### Nutrition Tips
1. eat more in the morning 2. Eat small melas throughout the day 3. Low glycemic index in the morning


#### Interval Training for physical and mental energy
How do we incorporate interval training into our mental routines? 
What would an interval look like? 
Intense focus on a new topic for x minutes without distraction, and then a break? 
Taking a short test, assessment, or problem, and then a break? 


Brain fun fact - weighs 2% of the body, and uses 20% of the oxygen

None of us have our best ideas at work. 

We should all be working out our brain until we die.

Spiritual energy
Drawing from a deep well of spiritual energy almost always relates to a form of sacrifice. Probably good to read Start With Why to learn about tactics for finding your spirituality and purpose.
1. Being able to quite smoking/drinking for the sake of my child.
2. Working a difficult and horrible job to help victims of a natural disaster
3. 


 The last few paragraphs are great. It takes an active courage to think of others before yourself, but just like all good things in life, after getting over that initial leap, you will receive outside rewards for your courage. Some of these rewards might be quite selfish, in a day, make you feel good, and bring you a more rich life through the community you’ve created by being selfless.

## Chapter 3 - How To Make Change

Defining motivation, as “self authored”, is an amazing piece of language to describe intrinsic motivation.

"Money may not buy you happiness, but happiness may help you get rich"

**Questions to answer**

Think of someone you deeply respect, describe three qualities of this person that you most admire?

Who are you at your best?

What one-sentence description would you like to see on your tombstone that would capture who you really were in your life?


**Denial**
We all have an infinite capacity for self-deception.

Avoiding the truth in the short term, increases the risk of ruin later. 

Denial makes a slash out at others and put them down in place of ourselves

**Facing the truth Questions**

## Chapter 4 - Taking Action

We have the capacity for very few conscious acts of self control every day. 

It is critical to experiment with energy renewal rituals throughout our day. Things that will take conscious effort at first, but then will become autopilot items that maintain our energy levels. 


Deadlines work. 

Implement change in small pieces. If you push too hard, the a higher likelihood that you will fail. 

Chart the course - review purpose and vision before engaging in new habits.
