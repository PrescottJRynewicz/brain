## Introduction

Everyone has art to create, but the industrial revolution has turned the world into a place where people are taught to be cogs in a machine and suppress their unique perspective. 

[[Do not internalize the industrial model. You are not one of the myriad of interchangeable pieces, but a unique human being, and if you've got something to say, say it, and think well of yourself while you're learning to say it better.]]


## The New World Of Work

After the Industrial Revolution, the factory model was the most significant business and economic structure worldwide. 

Businesses were successful by having the lowest [[PERL]], and intelligent, enterprising people knew how to leverage our biology against us. They created a deal: "You don't have to do hard, uncomfortable work, and we'll take care of you." You might have to do hard physical work, but not the much more difficult emotional, mental, and creative work.

The factory model has created a race to the bottom. This business strategy is still valid, but you should understand the consequences and asymptotes you will face when running a race to the bottom. 

The internet has accelerated the race to the bottom. Now, you don't have to organize people into a rectangular cube in the middle of nowhere to create the most efficient process. You can hire highly skilled people online, outsource your computers to Amazon, and print products overnight without seeing them. The ability to create cheap goods is reaching peak efficiency and now has diminishing returns.

## Thinking About Your Worth

## INDOCTRINATION: HOW WE GOT HERE

*We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class, of necessity, in every society, to forgo the privileges of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks."*

Woodrow Wilson

The factory model shaped education.

The well-known anecdote is that the most influential and remarkable people never finished their higher education (Mark Zuckerburg dropping out of Harvard). We place importance on the heroic people in this situation, not the fact that most schools were designed for us to be factory workers and compliant with a system of rules.

[[Law of Linchpin Leverage]] 
[[Know Your Worth]]

Mastering a craft and having deep domain knowledge does not make you a linchpin. Being able to see the reality of the situation, and come up with creative solutions to meet a shared mission is how can become a linchpin. This is why some of the most valuable executives and leaders don't have any formal or technical skills.

## Is it Possible to Do Hard Work in a Cubicle?

[[Passion isn't project-specific. It's people-specific. Some people are hooked on passion, deriving their sense of self from the act of being passionate.]]

[[It's not an effort content, it's an art content.]]

This chapter is a discussion about what art is, how it can applied to different fields, and arguments for why you should create more art to become indispensable.

Know who your audience is. [[Creating art for yourself is very different than creating it for others.]] 

## The Resistance

Artists don't think outside the box, because outside the box there's a vacuum. Outside of the box there are no rules, there is no reality. You have nothing to interact with, nothing to work against. If you set out to do something way outside the box (designing a time machine, or using liquid nitrogen to freeze Niagara Falls), then you'll never be able to do the real work of art. 

[[You can't ship if you're far outside the box.]] 

The only purpose of starting is to finish, so that you can start again.

## The Powerful Culture of Gifts

We give gifts to the people in our tribe. Gifts come without interest and make the tribe stronger. The only reason we do anything is to have a tribe that we love, support, and supports us.

If you give a valuable enough gift, one that nobody will ever be able to repay you for (i.e. Linus Torvarlds creating Linux), it is almost certain that you will never have to look for work again. You will have the new challenge of choosing what you want to do to give you purpose.

## There is No Map

Overall, there is good background info about how it is all creators job to define their own map, but not a lot of good strategies. As Seth states, that is the crux of the problem. You have to create your own map. 

I think [[The Scout Mindset]] and [[The Power Of Full Engagement]] have more info about skills to practice to get better at knowing what map you want to make, and how to create it.

[[Most of the time, we're doing non-linchpin work, doing someone else's work instead of our art. That's fine, as long as there's a balance, as long as you leave enough time for the work that matters.]]
