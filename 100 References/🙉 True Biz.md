### Book Review
---
True Biz is an inspiring, infuriating, and beautiful novel. For myself, who has little knowledge of the deaf world, *True Biz* gave me a lens to understand the struggles that hard-of-hearing people experience daily and systematically. 

*True Biz* taught me that *"over 90% of deaf kids are born to hearing parents, and only eight percent of those parents ever learn enough ASL to hold a conversation with their child."* *True Biz* taught me that deaf children are taught to be aliens in a human world. *True Biz* taught me that the Deaf world has been failed by the capitalisms narcissistic edge, and it is not a "problem" that money or innovation will solve: it's an opportunity for human empathy. 

The benefits of empowering the deaf community is not easily measure-able ([[üìê Goodhart's Law]]), and the alienation of the deaf community is not solvable by one person, organization or business. It is a slow uphill climb, where empathy and human connection matter far more than a sales number or a political candidates approval rating: deaf people are the minority, and need support from the hearing majority.

## Discussion Questions

#### Discuss the pros and cons of cochlear implants and the ethical considerations for parents, medical professionals, and medical device companies. 

Let's state a few assumptions and beliefs I have. 

Hearing is a wonderful gift. The beauty of language and music creates beautiful bonds between people. Music is a universal language for all hearing people. 

Deaf people are not disabled, but a minority and every minority will always struggle to be understood by the majority.

The experience gap between deaf and hearing people is naturally large and hard to cross. 

With these assumptions, the question at the root of cochlear implants isn't "should deaf people be able to hear?", but rather, "How do we close the gap between the deaf and hearing experience."


From this POV, I think the continued development of Cochlear implants is one approach to help bridge the gap between the hearing and deaf communities. I also think giving everyone the gift of hearing is a worthy cause. However, cochlear implant medical device companies have epically failed to create appropriate inventive structures to solve the root problem of closing the gap between deaf and hearing people. Instead, they have focused on making money instead of giving people the gift of hearing. 

Here are some ideas that I can think of, although altruistic, that would improve the ethics of this venture:

1. Government support to avoid purely financial-based incentive structures that lead to a cascade of un-ethical decisions.
2. Pairing implant language therapy with sign language instruction so that naturally hard-of-hearing children can flourish and have the opportunity to flourish in both languages. 
3. Education from the device companies for parents and children that it is not a choice between hearing and deafness, the same way that learning multiple languages as a child is encouraged.
4. Non-profit siblings to for-profit device companies that focus on closing the gap between the deaf and hearing communities through education for hearing people.
