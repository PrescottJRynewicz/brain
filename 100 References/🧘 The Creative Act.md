# ðŸ§˜ The Creative Act

Authentic and beautifully written. If I saved every quote from the book that spoke to me, I would have copied a quarter of the book. Inspiring to anyone, we can all benefit from being a little more aware of Source, and know a little more strategy about shipping creative works. 


## Tuning In
Source (everything around us) is infinite. We are antennae, receiving information from Source. How we tune into that information is very important. Some people are much more sensitive by default, but we all can do our best to improve the clarity of signal we receive. 

Our senses are the signal receivers, and our consciousness is the decoder and filter. We can employ strategies for improving our receivers (blocking out distractions, not watching a youtube video, etc...) and improving our decoder (meditation, clearing our mind of wandering, intrusive thoughts, pre-seeding other relevant Source material). 

## The Source Of Creativity 
All things are connected. All creation is collaborative because it respects all things created before it. 

If you were inspired by the light shining through a set of branches in a forest, then you collaborated with the tree, the sun, and all the people who created works inspiring your current train of thought. The idea was there, and you presented yourself for it.

## Awareness
Awareness and analyses are not the same thing. You cannot analyze while you are being aware. Analysis marks the end of awareness. 

## The Unseen

When working on a creative pursuit, especially when it has captured your passion, it is strange how unlikely items begin to relate to your topic. The way a cafe smells might give you an idea about your technical problem. The sound of tires on the road might help you complete the lyrics to a song. Something your friend says might jostle free a design you were stuck on. 

There is no right or wrong answer to how or why these items from Source are connected. 

## Look For Clues
When focusing on a project, it can be helpful to look for clues. The project creates a filter or direction for analysis. All Source has the chance to hold related or valuable information. 

You might find clues in a random book, the newspaper, on a morning walk, etc...

## Practice

There is a reason that Yogis call yoga "A Practice." Awareness and creativity cannot become secondary habits. It will also require focus and effort, and we will always be practicing it for the rest of our lives. 

## Nothing is Static
The world is always changing. Our consciousness is also always changing. 

## Look Inward
Source information is infinitely available inside of us, just as it is us. The culmination of our memories, senses, and current state is a wealth of information. 

## Memories and The Subconscious
