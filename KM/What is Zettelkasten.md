# What
A system for collecting thoughts into a [[Graph]] of ideas. 


# Principles
### Hyperlinked
Each note can be related to any other note. A graph.
### Atomic 
Each note covers only one thought. A thought is somewhat hard to define, but it should be clearly identifiable by you, and also have clear boundaries from all other thoughts. **It also has a unique identifier**. 
### Every person has one Zettelkasten
